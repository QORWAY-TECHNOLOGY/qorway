# Security & Compliance

**QORWAY Decision Intelligence Infrastructure**

> QORWAY does not only secure data.  
> It secures decisions, reasoning, execution, and feedback.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the public-safe security and compliance principles for QORWAY.

QORWAY is designed as a sovereign decision intelligence infrastructure where every decision must be:

- tenant-scoped
- explainable
- constrained
- executable only after validation
- auditable
- aligned with regulatory and governance requirements

Security is not a feature.

Security is part of the decision runtime.

---

## 2. Security Philosophy

Traditional systems secure:

```text
data → application → user access
````

QORWAY secures:

```text
data → reasoning → decision → validation → execution → feedback
```

This means QORWAY must protect:

* enterprise data
* Knowledge Graph structures
* causal reasoning paths
* Domain Pack configurations
* PolicyCore validation results
* PulseFlow execution events
* GreenCore routing decisions
* tenant feedback loops
* audit evidence

---

## 3. Core Security Principles

QORWAY follows seven core security principles.

---

### 3.1 Sovereignty by Design

QORWAY is designed for sovereign deployment.

Security must support:

* EU-based infrastructure
* data residency requirements
* restricted cross-border processing
* tenant-controlled data boundaries
* jurisdiction-aware execution

Sensitive workloads must remain within approved execution boundaries.

---

### 3.2 Zero Trust Architecture

No actor, service, agent, request, or event is trusted by default.

Every operation must be:

* authenticated
* authorized
* tenant-scoped
* logged
* validated against policy where required

Zero Trust applies across the full runtime.

---

### 3.3 Tenant Isolation

Every tenant must operate inside an isolated decision environment.

Isolation applies to:

* data
* Knowledge Graphs
* Domain Pack instantiations
* PolicyCore constraints
* PulseFlow events
* GreenCore execution policies
* agent execution context
* audit logs
* feedback signals

Core rule:

> One tenant’s graph, events, or feedback must never become another tenant’s intelligence.

---

### 3.4 Constraint-First Execution

No decision can move to execution unless PolicyCore validates it.

Execution is invalid if it:

* bypasses PolicyCore
* lacks tenant scope
* lacks causal lineage
* lacks audit metadata
* violates tenant policy
* misses required human approval

Core rule:

> No PolicyCore validation → no PulseFlow execution.

---

### 3.5 Traceability by Default

Every decision and execution path must be traceable.

A complete trace should include:

* tenant ID
* decision ID
* causal chain
* Domain Pack version
* PolicyCore result
* PulseFlow execution event
* GreenCore routing decision
* execution outcome
* feedback reference

A decision that cannot be traced is invalid.

---

### 3.6 Least Privilege

Every user, service, agent, and system component should have only the permissions required to perform its defined role.

Least privilege applies to:

* users
* AI agents
* services
* API access
* event consumers
* graph queries
* execution workflows

No component should have global access by default.

---

### 3.7 Secure Feedback Loops

Feedback must never create uncontrolled learning or data leakage.

Feedback must be:

* tenant-scoped
* governed
* auditable
* anonymized before any universal reuse
* blocked from cross-tenant exposure

Core rule:

> Feedback improves the system only inside approved governance boundaries.

---

## 4. Compliance Targets

QORWAY is designed to support alignment with:

* GDPR
* EU AI Act
* ISO 27001 principles
* SOC 2 Type II principles
* enterprise audit requirements
* public-sector transparency requirements
* CSRD / ESG traceability where applicable

This document is not legal advice.

It defines the system-level compliance posture of QORWAY.

---

## 5. GDPR Alignment

QORWAY supports GDPR-aligned architecture through:

* tenant isolation
* data minimization
* access control
* encryption
* audit logging
* restricted processing
* data residency controls
* privacy-aware routing
* clear separation between private and reusable knowledge

Sensitive personal data must not be exposed across tenants or to unauthorized services.

---

## 6. EU AI Act Alignment

QORWAY is designed for high-accountability AI environments.

The system supports:

* explainability
* human oversight
* risk management
* technical documentation
* logging
* transparency
* data governance
* accountability

QORWAY does not rely on post-hoc explanation.

Explanation is generated as part of the decision lifecycle.

---

## 7. Sovereign Infrastructure

QORWAY should support deployment across:

```text
local
edge
EU cloud
```

Execution routing is governed by:

* PolicyCore constraints
* GreenCore execution policies
* tenant requirements
* data sensitivity
* jurisdictional constraints

Sensitive data must remain inside approved infrastructure boundaries.

GreenCore may optimize execution only within allowed boundaries.

---

## 8. Data Classification

QORWAY data should be classified into four categories:

```text
UNIVERSAL
PRIVATE
SENSITIVE
REGULATED
```

---

### 8.1 UNIVERSAL

Reusable, non-identifiable domain structure.

Examples:

* public ontology
* generic causal rules
* public regulatory references
* anonymized abstractions where approved

---

### 8.2 PRIVATE

Tenant-specific organizational data.

Examples:

* internal workflows
* tenant decisions
* private graph structures
* organization-specific execution history

---

### 8.3 SENSITIVE

High-risk or confidential data requiring enhanced controls.

Examples:

* financial exposure
* HR-related data
* strategic plans
* supplier dependency maps
* internal risk structures

---

### 8.4 REGULATED

Data subject to legal, sectoral, or jurisdictional requirements.

Examples:

* personal data
* public-sector decision data
* high-risk AI decision logs
* regulated financial data
* compliance evidence

---

## 9. Encryption Standards

Minimum encryption expectations:

* AES-256 for data at rest
* TLS 1.3 for data in transit
* encrypted backups
* encrypted secrets
* encrypted sensitive graph storage where required

Encryption must apply to:

* databases
* object storage
* event payloads where required
* backups
* secrets
* sensitive configuration

---

## 10. Identity & Access Management

QORWAY should support role-based access control.

Example roles:

| Role                   | Responsibility                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Executive              | Reviews strategic decisions           |
| CFO                    | Approves capital allocation decisions |
| Compliance Officer     | Reviews regulated decisions           |
| Risk Officer           | Reviews systemic risk                 |
| Sustainability Officer | Reviews ESG / carbon exposure         |
| Domain Operator        | Executes domain workflows             |
| System Admin           | Manages infrastructure access         |
| AI Agent               | Performs bounded execution tasks      |

Every role must operate under explicit permissions.

---

## 11. Agent Security

AI agents must be bounded by:

* tenant scope
* allowed events
* allowed actions
* PolicyCore status
* PulseFlow workflow context
* human approval requirements
* audit logging

Agents must never:

* execute outside PulseFlow
* bypass PolicyCore
* access unauthorized tenant data
* modify causal rules without governance
* call external systems without authorization
* generate unlogged actions

---

## 12. Knowledge Graph Security

The Knowledge Graph must enforce:

* tenant-scoped access
* graph namespace isolation
* node and edge access controls where required
* no cross-tenant traversal
* no inference leakage
* audit logs for sensitive graph access
* controlled graph mutations
* versioned schema updates

Core rule:

> Private graph intelligence must remain private.

---

## 13. Domain Pack Security

Domain Packs must be classified as either:

```text
Standard Domain Pack
Private Domain Pack
```

Standard Domain Packs may contain reusable domain structure.

Private Domain Packs may contain tenant-specific operating logic.

Security requirements:

* no private data inside Standard Packs
* version control for pack updates
* validation before runtime loading
* PolicyCore compatibility
* no untraceable causal rules
* no actions without PulseFlow events
* no feedback leakage into universal systems without governance

---

## 14. PolicyCore Security

PolicyCore is the primary runtime constraint authority.

It must enforce:

* constraint validation before execution
* human approval where required
* tenant-specific rules
* regulatory constraints
* ESG and financial limits
* execution eligibility

PolicyCore must never be bypassed by:

* Atlas
* PulseFlow
* GreenCore
* agents
* external integrations

Core rule:

> If PolicyCore rejects a decision, no execution may occur.

---

## 15. PulseFlow Security

PulseFlow must ensure that every event is:

* tenant-scoped
* authenticated
* authorized
* traceable
* replayable where required
* linked to a validated decision where applicable

PulseFlow must support:

* correlation IDs
* event-level access control
* immutable execution logs
* dead letter handling
* idempotent consumers
* audit trail generation

PulseFlow must never execute rejected or unvalidated decisions.

---

## 16. GreenCore Security

GreenCore must optimize only approved execution paths.

It must enforce:

* tenant execution policies
* data sensitivity rules
* approved execution zones
* carbon trace integrity
* routing audit logs
* no unauthorized cloud escalation
* no silent routing changes

GreenCore must never:

* override PolicyCore
* route execution outside approved boundaries
* hide carbon or cost impact
* remove audit metadata

---

## 17. Audit Trail Requirements

Every governed decision must generate audit evidence.

Audit evidence may include:

* causal evidence log
* decision trace
* Domain Pack version
* PolicyCore validation result
* human approval event
* PulseFlow execution log
* GreenCore routing trace
* carbon trace
* execution outcome
* feedback record

Audit trails must answer:

```text
What decision was made?
Why was it made?
Which rules applied?
Which constraints were checked?
Who approved it?
How was it executed?
Where was it executed?
What happened afterward?
What did the system learn?
```

---

## 18. Human Oversight

Human oversight must be supported where required by:

* regulation
* tenant policy
* high financial exposure
* high ESG impact
* public interest
* low confidence score
* simulation drift
* sensitive domain classification

Human approval must be logged and linked to the decision trace.

---

## 19. Logging & Monitoring

QORWAY should monitor:

* authentication events
* authorization failures
* PolicyCore rejections
* PulseFlow execution failures
* GreenCore routing anomalies
* cross-tenant access attempts
* graph mutation events
* agent execution events
* feedback drift signals

Logs must avoid unnecessary sensitive data exposure.

---

## 20. Incident Response Principles

Security incidents should be handled under a defined response model.

Incident categories may include:

* unauthorized access
* tenant boundary violation
* PolicyCore bypass attempt
* unapproved execution
* graph data leakage
* event replay anomaly
* secret exposure
* agent boundary violation
* data residency violation

Response should include:

* containment
* evidence preservation
* root cause analysis
* tenant impact assessment
* corrective action
* governance update where required

---

## 21. Public vs Private Repository Boundary

Public repositories may contain:

* high-level architecture
* governance principles
* public-safe standards
* overview documents
* non-sensitive examples

Private repositories must contain:

* implementation details
* internal prompts
* full Domain Pack rules
* scoring systems
* production schemas
* routing logic
* detailed PolicyCore rules
* proprietary causal models

Core rule:

> Public documentation builds trust. Private infrastructure protects the moat.

---

## 22. Security Failure Conditions

A system state is security-invalid if:

* tenant boundaries are broken
* a decision bypasses PolicyCore
* execution occurs outside PulseFlow
* GreenCore routes outside approved boundaries
* private tenant data appears in a Standard Pack
* feedback leaks across tenants
* causal lineage cannot be reconstructed
* audit evidence is missing
* agents execute outside allowed roles
* secrets are exposed

---

## 23. What QORWAY Security Is Not

QORWAY security is not:

* a checklist
* a late-stage audit task
* a dashboard
* an access control layer only
* an infrastructure-only concern
* a compliance claim without evidence

It is a runtime property of the decision system.

---

## 24. Strategic Importance

Security and compliance are central to QORWAY’s market position.

QORWAY is designed for environments where decisions must be:

* explainable
* governed
* sovereign
* auditable
* safe to execute
* trusted by institutions and enterprises

This is essential for:

* regulated enterprises
* public-sector systems
* finance
* ESG / CSRD
* risk management
* AI Act-aligned infrastructure
* sovereign European adoption

---

## 25. Final Statement

QORWAY security protects more than data.

It protects the integrity of the full decision lifecycle:

```text
data → reasoning → decision → validation → execution → feedback
```

Final system statement:

> QORWAY makes intelligence secure enough to execute.
