# CI/CD Standards

**QORWAY Decision Intelligence Infrastructure**

> QORWAY does not only release code.  
> It releases decision infrastructure.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the CI/CD standard for QORWAY.

The goal is to ensure that every release preserves:

- tenant isolation
- causal traceability
- Domain Pack integrity
- PolicyCore validation
- PulseFlow execution reliability
- GreenCore optimization boundaries
- audit readiness
- security posture

QORWAY releases must protect decision integrity, not only software stability.

---

## 2. CI/CD Philosophy

Traditional CI/CD validates:

```text
code → build → deploy
````

QORWAY CI/CD must validate:

```text
code → graph → causal rules → constraints → events → execution → feedback
```

A release is not valid if it breaks the Decision Intelligence Loop.

Core principle:

> A bug in QORWAY is not only a software defect. It can become a decision defect.

---

## 3. Release Units

A QORWAY release may include updates to:

* application code
* system services
* Knowledge Graph schemas
* Domain Packs
* causal rules
* PolicyCore constraints
* PulseFlow event schemas
* GreenCore routing policies
* agent definitions
* feedback rules
* governance documentation

Each release must declare what type of system surface it affects.

---

## 4. Branching Model

QORWAY follows a controlled trunk-based development model.

Recommended branches:

```text
main
feat/<feature-name>
fix/<issue-name>
docs/<document-name>
chore/<maintenance-task>
```

Rules:

* `main` represents the stable public or production-ready state.
* all changes must go through pull requests.
* no direct commits to `main` for system-critical repositories.
* every pull request must include a clear description of system impact.

---

## 5. Pull Request Requirements

Every pull request should include:

* purpose of the change
* affected layer
* risk level
* testing performed
* security impact
* tenant isolation impact
* documentation impact
* rollback considerations

Example affected layers:

```text
Atlas
Domain Packs
PolicyCore
PulseFlow
GreenCore
Knowledge Graph
Security
Documentation
```

A PR is incomplete if it does not explain how it affects the QORWAY system map.

---

## 6. Validation Gates

Every release should pass a set of validation gates before merge or deployment.

---

## Gate 1 — Structure & Type Validation

Purpose:

> Ensure the system structure remains coherent.

Checks may include:

* linting
* type checking
* schema validation
* documentation formatting
* repository structure validation
* broken link checks
* naming convention validation

For technical repositories, this may include:

* TypeScript strict mode
* OpenAPI validation
* AsyncAPI validation
* JSON Schema validation
* YAML validation

A release fails if it breaks structural contracts.

---

## Gate 2 — Domain Pack Integrity

Purpose:

> Ensure Domain Packs remain valid executable intelligence structures.

Checks should validate:

* `domain.yaml` exists
* graph schema is valid
* causal rules are explainable
* decision policies are linked to actions
* PolicyCore constraints exist where required
* GreenCore policies exist where required
* events are mapped to PulseFlow
* feedback rules exist for measurable outcomes
* STEPS impact model exists where required
* no orphan critical nodes
* no risk without mitigation path
* no action without event path
* no private tenant data in Standard Domain Packs

Core rule:

> A Domain Pack cannot be released if it cannot produce an audit-ready decision trace.

---

## Gate 3 — Causal Reasoning Validation

Purpose:

> Ensure decision logic remains causal, explainable, and traceable.

Checks should validate:

* every decision can reference causal lineage
* every causal rule has a defined cause and effect
* causal weights or confidence values are present where required
* impact simulations are linked to outcomes
* decision outputs remain explainable
* feedback rules exist for recalibration

A release fails if it introduces untraceable reasoning.

---

## Gate 4 — PolicyCore Constraint Validation

Purpose:

> Ensure no decision path bypasses governance.

Checks should validate:

* decisions requiring validation are routed through PolicyCore
* rejected decisions cannot move to PulseFlow execution
* modified decisions preserve modification trace
* human approval constraints are enforced
* tenant policies are respected
* regulatory and ESG constraints are not weakened silently

Core rule:

```text
No PolicyCore validation → no PulseFlow execution.
```

---

## Gate 5 — PulseFlow Event Validation

Purpose:

> Ensure execution remains event-driven, traceable, and replayable.

Checks should validate:

* event schemas are valid
* events include `tenant_id`
* events include correlation IDs where required
* decision execution events reference decision IDs
* event consumers are idempotent
* events are compatible with AsyncAPI contracts
* execution paths produce audit logs
* feedback events exist for measurable outcomes

A release fails if it creates execution without event traceability.

---

## Gate 6 — GreenCore Routing Validation

Purpose:

> Ensure execution optimization remains within approved boundaries.

Checks should validate:

* GreenCore cannot override PolicyCore
* sensitive workloads remain within approved execution zones
* routing decisions are logged
* carbon traces are produced where required
* tenant execution policies are respected
* cloud escalation is not silent
* fallback routes are defined

Core rule:

> GreenCore optimizes approved execution paths only.

---

## Gate 7 — Security & Tenant Isolation

Purpose:

> Ensure the release does not compromise sovereignty or security.

Checks should validate:

* no secrets committed
* no sensitive data included in public repositories
* no cross-tenant access path
* no private tenant data in Standard Domain Packs
* access control rules remain intact
* encrypted data handling is preserved
* logs avoid unnecessary sensitive data exposure

Recommended automated checks:

* secret scanning
* dependency audit
* static application security testing
* container scanning where applicable
* permission review

A release fails immediately if tenant isolation is weakened.

---

## Gate 8 — Feedback Loop Validation

Purpose:

> Ensure execution outcomes can update the system safely.

Checks should validate:

* execution produces outcome events
* feedback events map back to decisions
* feedback updates are tenant-scoped
* simulation drift thresholds are defined where required
* diagnostic signals trigger human review where required
* feedback cannot leak into Universal Knowledge Graph without governance

A release fails if it breaks the learning loop.

---

## 7. Deployment Strategy

For production-grade systems, QORWAY should use controlled deployment strategies.

Recommended models:

* blue / green deployment
* canary deployment
* staged rollout
* feature flags for critical logic
* rollback-ready migrations

Critical changes should never be deployed without rollback planning.

---

## 8. Database & Graph Migration Rules

Schema and graph changes require special care.

Rules:

* migrations must be versioned
* destructive migrations require approval
* graph schema changes must be backward-compatible where possible
* Domain Pack schema changes must declare version impact
* tenant graph migrations must preserve isolation
* rollback path must be documented
* audit data must not be deleted silently

Core rule:

> Never break historical decision traceability.

---

## 9. Domain Pack Versioning

Every Domain Pack release must include:

* version number
* changelog
* affected graph nodes
* affected causal rules
* affected PolicyCore constraints
* affected PulseFlow events
* affected GreenCore policies
* affected feedback rules
* migration notes

Example version format:

```text
finance_pack@1.2.0
csrd_pack@1.1.0
supply_chain_pack@1.0.3
```

Production tenants must not be silently upgraded to a critical Domain Pack version without governance approval.

---

## 10. Audit Trail Preservation

Releases must preserve the ability to reconstruct historical decisions.

A historical audit trail may reference:

* Domain Pack version
* graph schema version
* causal rule version
* PolicyCore result
* PulseFlow event schema
* GreenCore routing policy
* feedback rule version

If any version changes, historical references must remain interpretable.

---

## 11. Public Repository CI/CD

For public repositories, CI/CD should focus on:

* markdown validation
* broken link checks
* file structure checks
* no secrets scanning
* no internal-only terms accidentally exposed
* no private Domain Pack content
* no prompts or proprietary implementation logic

Public repositories build trust.

They should never expose the moat.

---

## 12. Private Repository CI/CD

For private repositories, CI/CD should validate:

* source code
* schemas
* prompts
* Domain Packs
* causal rules
* constraints
* event contracts
* tests
* deployment artifacts
* security scans

Private repositories protect implementation and IP.

They may contain the real system logic.

---

## 13. AI-Assisted Development Rules

AI-generated code or documentation must be treated as untrusted until validated.

AI-assisted changes must pass the same gates as human-written changes.

AI must not:

* create unscoped tenant access
* introduce hidden execution paths
* bypass PolicyCore
* create events without audit metadata
* expose private prompts
* expose Domain Pack internals in public repos
* weaken security or governance language
* invent unsupported system behavior

Core rule:

> AI can assist generation. It cannot approve architecture.

---

## 14. Rollback Conditions

A release should be rolled back if it causes:

* tenant isolation failure
* PolicyCore validation failure
* PulseFlow execution failure
* GreenCore routing violation
* missing audit trails
* broken decision lineage
* graph schema incompatibility
* major latency degradation
* security incident
* Domain Pack misclassification
* feedback loop corruption

---

## 15. Monitoring After Release

After release, the system should monitor:

* error rates
* execution failures
* PolicyCore rejections
* PulseFlow dead letter events
* GreenCore routing anomalies
* latency by layer
* tenant boundary violations
* missing feedback events
* audit trace completeness
* unexpected causal drift

Monitoring must include decision integrity signals, not only infrastructure health.

---

## 16. Release Documentation

Every release should include a release note.

A release note should contain:

* version
* release date
* affected components
* affected tenants if applicable
* risk level
* validation summary
* rollback plan
* known limitations
* audit impact

Example:

```text
Release: domain-pack-csrd@1.1.0
Affected layers: Domain Packs, PolicyCore, PulseFlow
Risk level: Medium
Validation: Passed Gates 1–8
Rollback: csrd_pack@1.0.0
```

---

## 17. What QORWAY CI/CD Is Not

QORWAY CI/CD is not:

* deployment automation only
* a build pipeline only
* a software release checklist
* a DevOps afterthought
* a speed optimization tool

It is a decision integrity protection system.

---

## 18. Strategic Importance

QORWAY’s credibility depends on the reliability of its releases.

A release can affect:

* causal reasoning
* governance boundaries
* execution behavior
* tenant trust
* regulatory compliance
* auditability
* learning quality

CI/CD is therefore part of the product.

It ensures that QORWAY remains safe to execute as it evolves.

---

## 19. Final Statement

QORWAY CI/CD protects the integrity of the full decision lifecycle:

```text
data → graph → reasoning → constraints → execution → feedback
```

Final system statement:

> QORWAY releases must never break decision integrity.
