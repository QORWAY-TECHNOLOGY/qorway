# Decision Trace Example 

**QORWAY Decision Intelligence Infrastructure**

> This example illustrates how QORWAY conceptually traces a decision from signal to reasoning, validation, execution, and feedback without exposing proprietary schemas, scoring models, rules, prompts, or production logic.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a simplified public example of a QORWAY decision trace.

It demonstrates how a decision can move through the QORWAY runtime:

```text
signal → graph → reasoning → constraint validation → execution → optimization → feedback
````

This example is intentionally high-level.

It does not expose:

* internal schemas
* production event contracts
* causal weights
* scoring formulas
* PolicyCore rules
* GreenCore routing rules
* prompts
* tenant-specific data
* implementation logic

---

## 2. What This Example Represents

This example uses a fictional situation:

```text
Operational delay detected in a critical business process.
```

The goal is to show how QORWAY would conceptually trace the decision lifecycle.

This is not a real customer case.

It is not a production trace.

It is a public-safe illustration.

---

## 3. Decision Trace Overview

A QORWAY decision trace connects:

```text
Source Signal
  ↓
Knowledge Graph Context
  ↓
Atlas Reasoning
  ↓
Domain Pack Context
  ↓
PolicyCore Validation
  ↓
PulseFlow Orchestration
  ↓
GreenCore Optimization
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Feedback
  ↓
Learning Update
```

Each stage creates evidence that can be reviewed, audited, and linked back to the original decision.

---

## 4. Step 1 — Source Signal

A source signal indicates that something meaningful has changed.

Example conceptual signal:

```text
A critical workflow is taking longer than expected.
```

Possible signal categories:

* operational signal
* financial signal
* compliance signal
* ESG signal
* risk signal
* human decision signal
* external regulatory signal

The signal becomes relevant only when it is connected to system context.

---

## 5. Step 2 — Knowledge Graph Context

The signal updates or activates part of the Knowledge Graph.

Example conceptual graph context:

```text
Workflow delay
  ↓
Operational dependency
  ↓
Delivery risk
  ↓
Potential financial impact
```

The Knowledge Graph helps QORWAY understand that the signal is not isolated.

It may affect:

* risks
* gates
* outcomes
* dependencies
* execution priorities

---

## 6. Step 3 — Atlas Reasoning

Atlas reasons over the Knowledge Graph.

Atlas identifies:

* what changed
* why it matters
* which causal path is active
* which risk or opportunity is emerging
* what decision path should be considered

Example conceptual reasoning:

```text
The workflow delay may increase delivery risk.
Delivery risk may affect expected business outcome.
A mitigation decision should be considered.
```

Atlas does not execute.

Atlas produces structured decision intelligence.

---

## 7. Step 4 — Domain Pack Context

The relevant Domain Pack contextualizes the decision.

The Domain Pack may define:

* domain-specific entities
* allowed actions
* risks
* gates
* outcomes
* feedback expectations
* systemic impact lens

Example conceptual context:

```text
This type of delay belongs to an operational resilience domain.
Relevant actions may include escalation, rerouting, or human review.
```

The Domain Pack ensures the decision is not generic.

---

## 8. Step 5 — Decision Candidate

QORWAY generates a decision candidate.

Conceptual structure:

```text
Decision Candidate
├── reason
├── causal explanation
├── recommended action
├── expected impact
├── required validation
├── execution requirement
└── feedback expectation
```

Example conceptual decision:

```text
Prepare a mitigation workflow to reduce the operational delay risk.
```

This is not yet executable.

It must pass constraint validation.

---

## 9. Step 6 — PolicyCore Validation

PolicyCore checks whether the decision is allowed to move forward.

PolicyCore may evaluate:

* tenant policy
* regulatory constraints
* operational capacity
* financial exposure
* ESG constraints
* human approval requirements
* data handling restrictions

Possible outcomes:

```text
APPROVED
MODIFIED
REJECTED
```

Example conceptual validation:

```text
Decision approved with human oversight required before execution.
```

Core rule:

> No decision can become executable without PolicyCore validation.

---

## 10. Step 7 — PulseFlow Orchestration

Once validated, PulseFlow converts the decision into an execution flow.

PulseFlow may create:

* execution event
* workflow
* agent task
* human approval request
* system update
* execution log
* feedback requirement

Example conceptual orchestration:

```text
Create mitigation workflow.
Notify responsible operator.
Prepare execution task.
Track outcome.
```

PulseFlow ensures the decision becomes governed execution.

---

## 11. Step 8 — GreenCore Optimization

GreenCore determines how the approved execution should happen.

GreenCore may evaluate:

* local execution
* edge execution
* cloud execution
* cost
* latency
* carbon footprint
* data sensitivity
* sovereignty policy

Example conceptual optimization:

```text
Execute locally or at the edge because the task is low-compute and tenant-sensitive.
```

Core rule:

> GreenCore optimizes approved paths only. It cannot override PolicyCore.

---

## 12. Step 9 — Execution

The approved and optimized execution path is carried out.

Execution may involve:

* agent action
* workflow update
* human approval
* system notification
* enterprise tool update
* external API call where authorized

Example conceptual execution:

```text
The mitigation workflow is activated and assigned to the appropriate operator.
```

Execution must remain tenant-scoped and auditable.

---

## 13. Step 10 — Feedback

After execution, QORWAY captures feedback.

Feedback may include:

* actual outcome
* expected vs actual deviation
* execution delay
* financial impact
* operational impact
* compliance result
* carbon / compute impact
* human approval outcome

Example conceptual feedback:

```text
The delay was reduced, but the improvement was lower than expected.
```

Feedback allows the system to compare prediction with reality.

---

## 14. Step 11 — Learning Update

Feedback updates the Knowledge Graph and future reasoning.

Possible learning updates:

* causal confidence adjusted
* risk pattern updated
* action effectiveness updated
* feedback rule triggered
* diagnostic signal generated
* future recommendation refined

Example conceptual learning:

```text
The mitigation action was partially effective.
Future recommendations should consider an alternative path when similar delays occur.
```

Learning remains governed and tenant-scoped.

---

## 15. Conceptual Trace Summary

Domain Pack:

PolicyCore:

```

---

## 16. Trace Evidence

A complete QORWAY decision trace should be able to answer:

```text
What happened?
Why did it matter?
Which causal path was activated?
Which domain context applied?
What decision was proposed?
Which constraints were checked?
Was human approval required?
How was execution orchestrated?
Where was execution optimized?
What happened after execution?
What did the system learn?
```

This is what makes the decision auditable.

## 18. What Is Not Included

This public example intentionally excludes:

* production decision object
* production event schema
* internal JSON contracts
* causal weights
* scoring algorithms
* exact thresholds
* prompts
* PolicyCore implementation rules
* GreenCore routing rules
* PulseFlow orchestration contracts
* tenant-specific graph structures
* proprietary Domain Pack logic

These components belong in private QORWAY repositories.

---

## 19. Why Decision Traces Matter

Decision traces are central to QORWAY because they make intelligence:

* explainable
* governable
* executable
* auditable
* improvable

Traditional systems often produce outputs without traceable reasoning.

QORWAY is designed to preserve the full path from signal to outcome.

---

## 20. Final Statement

A QORWAY decision trace shows how a signal becomes a governed decision, how that decision becomes execution, and how execution becomes learning.

> Decision traces are how QORWAY makes intelligence accountable.
