# Domain Pack Example — Public-Safe

**QORWAY Decision Intelligence Infrastructure**

> This example illustrates how a Domain Pack is conceptually structured without exposing proprietary rules, schemas, scoring models, prompts, or execution logic.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a simplified public example of a QORWAY Domain Pack.

It shows how QORWAY thinks about domain-specific decision intelligence at a conceptual level.

It does not expose:

- production schemas
- causal rules
- internal scoring logic
- prompts
- PolicyCore implementation
- GreenCore routing logic
- PulseFlow event contracts
- tenant-specific data
- proprietary Domain Pack internals

---

## 2. What This Example Represents

This example uses a fictional domain:

```text
Operational Resilience Pack
```

This fictional pack is used only to demonstrate the conceptual structure of a Domain Pack.

It is not a real production Domain Pack.

---

## 3. Conceptual Domain Pack Definition

A Domain Pack defines how a domain is represented, reasoned about, constrained, executed, and improved.

Conceptually, a Domain Pack contains:

```text
Domain Pack
├── Domain Identity
├── Knowledge Structure
├── Causal Context
├── Decision Context
├── Constraint Context
├── Execution Context
├── Feedback Context
└── Impact Lens
```

Each section supports a different part of the QORWAY runtime.

---

## 4. Example Pack Identity

```text
Name: Operational Resilience Pack
Purpose: Help an organization understand and respond to operational disruption risk.
Domain Type: Resilience / Operations
Version: Public Example
Status: Illustrative Only
```

This identity helps the system understand what kind of domain context is being loaded.

---

## 5. Conceptual Knowledge Structure

The Domain Pack defines the kinds of objects that may exist in the domain.

Example conceptual entities:

```text
Operational Signal
Risk
Dependency
Action
Gate
Outcome
Feedback
```

These entities help QORWAY represent the domain as a structured system rather than a collection of unconnected data points.

---

## 6. Conceptual Relationship Types

The Domain Pack may define how entities relate to each other.

Example relationship types:

```text
Signal may indicate Risk
Risk may affect Outcome
Action may reduce Risk
Dependency may block Action
Outcome may generate Feedback
```

This enables causal reasoning without exposing proprietary graph models.

---

## 7. Conceptual Causal Context

A Domain Pack may define high-level causal patterns such as:

```text
If a critical operational signal changes,
then related risks should be evaluated.

If a risk exceeds an acceptable boundary,
then mitigation actions should be considered.

If an action is executed,
then the outcome should be observed and compared to the expected impact.
```

This is intentionally high-level.

The actual causal rules, weights, thresholds, and logic are proprietary.

---

## 8. Conceptual Decision Context

A Domain Pack may help Atlas convert causal understanding into decision candidates.

Example conceptual decision flow:

```text
1. Detect relevant signal
2. Identify affected risk
3. Evaluate possible action
4. Validate constraints
5. Prepare execution path
6. Observe outcome
```

In QORWAY, decision logic is not free-form recommendation generation.

It is structured, traceable, and governed.

---

## 9. PolicyCore Context

A Domain Pack may define which constraints should be considered before execution.

Example conceptual constraint categories:

```text
Regulatory constraint
Financial exposure constraint
Operational capacity constraint
Human approval requirement
Tenant-specific policy
```

PolicyCore remains the authority that validates whether a decision may move forward.

Core rule:

> Domain Packs provide context. PolicyCore validates constraints.

---

## 10. GreenCore Context

A Domain Pack may provide execution preferences for GreenCore.

Example conceptual preferences:

```text
Prefer local or edge execution for sensitive workloads.
Track carbon impact for relevant workflows.
Avoid unnecessary cloud execution.
Respect tenant execution policies.
```

GreenCore optimizes approved execution paths only.

Core rule:

> GreenCore optimizes execution. It does not override PolicyCore.

---

## 11. PulseFlow Context

A Domain Pack may define which kinds of execution events are expected.

Example conceptual events:

```text
Risk detected
Decision prepared
Action requested
Workflow started
Outcome observed
Feedback generated
```

This allows PulseFlow to orchestrate execution in a structured way.

Core rule:

> If a decision cannot become an event, it cannot become governed execution.

---

## 12. Feedback Context

A Domain Pack must define how outcomes are observed.

Example conceptual feedback:

```text
Expected outcome compared to actual outcome.
Execution delay measured.
Risk reduction observed.
Operational impact recorded.
Decision quality updated.
```

Feedback allows QORWAY to improve future reasoning through the Knowledge Graph.

---

## 13. Impact Lens

Some Domain Packs may include a systemic impact lens.

Example conceptual dimensions:

```text
Social impact
Technological impact
Economic impact
Policy impact
Sustainability impact
```

This allows QORWAY to evaluate decisions beyond local optimization.

The detailed impact model is proprietary.

---

## 14. How This Fits the QORWAY Runtime

```text
Domain Pack loaded
  ↓
Knowledge Graph enriched
  ↓
Atlas reasons with domain context
  ↓
PolicyCore validates constraints
  ↓
PulseFlow orchestrates execution
  ↓
GreenCore optimizes execution
  ↓
Feedback updates the Knowledge Graph
```

The Domain Pack does not replace the QORWAY core.

It configures the core for a specific domain.

---

## 15. Public-Safe Example Flow

Below is a simplified illustrative flow.

```text
Operational signal changes
  ↓
Related risk is identified
  ↓
Possible mitigation action is prepared
  ↓
PolicyCore checks constraints
  ↓
PulseFlow creates an execution workflow
  ↓
GreenCore selects an efficient execution path
  ↓
Outcome is observed
  ↓
Feedback updates future reasoning
```

This flow is conceptual only.

It does not expose production logic.

---

## 16. What Is Not Included

This public example intentionally excludes:

- exact graph schemas
- production node models
- real causal chains
- thresholds
- scoring formulas
- prompts
- execution contracts
- event payloads
- tenant data
- PolicyCore rules
- GreenCore routing rules
- agent implementation details

These belong in private QORWAY repositories.

---

## 17. Why Domain Packs Matter

Domain Packs allow QORWAY to become domain-aware without rewriting the core infrastructure.

They enable:

- reusable domain intelligence
- faster deployment
- governed execution
- audit-ready decisions
- tenant-specific extension
- feedback-based refinement

This is central to QORWAY’s platform model.

---

## 18. Final Statement

A Domain Pack is the mechanism that turns the QORWAY core into a domain-specific decision system.

> Domain Packs convert domain reality into causal, constrained, executable intelligence.
