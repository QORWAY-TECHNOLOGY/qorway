# GreenCore Overview

**QORWAY Execution Optimization Layer**

> GreenCore makes QORWAY not only intelligent and executable, but efficient, sovereign, and sustainable by design.

---

## 1. Definition

GreenCore™ is the execution optimization layer of QORWAY.

It determines where and how validated decisions should be executed across local, edge, and cloud environments while optimizing for:

- compute cost
- latency
- carbon footprint
- energy efficiency
- data sovereignty
- tenant execution policies

GreenCore answers one question:

> Where and how should this execute optimally?

GreenCore does not validate whether a decision is allowed.

That is PolicyCore.

GreenCore optimizes only approved execution paths.

---

## 2. Role in QORWAY OS

GreenCore exists because intelligence is not only about producing the right decision.

In enterprise and public-sector environments, execution must also be:

- cost-efficient
- energy-aware
- sovereign
- auditable
- aligned with tenant policies
- compatible with data sensitivity constraints

A decision may be:

- causally valid through Atlas
- contextualized by Domain Packs
- approved by PolicyCore
- orchestrated by PulseFlow

…but still require an execution strategy.

GreenCore provides that strategy.

It turns QORWAY from:

```text
decision intelligence
````

into:

```text
decision intelligence + optimized execution intelligence
```

---

## 3. Architecture Position

GreenCore sits after PolicyCore validation and after PulseFlow creates the execution request.

```text
ATLAS
  ↓
DOMAIN PACKS
  ↓
POLICYCORE
  ↓
PULSEFLOW
  ↓
GREENCORE
  ↓
LOCAL / EDGE / CLOUD EXECUTION
  ↓
FEEDBACK LOOP
```

Layer responsibilities:

* Atlas reasons.
* Domain Packs contextualize.
* PolicyCore validates.
* PulseFlow orchestrates execution.
* GreenCore optimizes execution.
* Agents and systems execute.
* Feedback updates the Knowledge Graph.

Core rule:

> PolicyCore defines what is allowed. GreenCore defines the best execution path for what is allowed.

---

## 4. What GreenCore Is Not

GreenCore is not:

* an ESG reporting module
* a carbon dashboard
* a compliance authority
* a decision engine
* a workflow orchestrator
* a legal validation layer
* a replacement for PolicyCore
* a replacement for PulseFlow

GreenCore is a runtime execution intelligence layer.

It optimizes execution conditions without weakening governance constraints.

---

## 5. Core Responsibilities

GreenCore is responsible for:

* execution routing
* local / edge / cloud selection
* energy-aware workload allocation
* carbon impact estimation
* compute cost optimization
* sovereignty-aware execution decisions
* tenant execution policy enforcement
* routing audit logs
* execution efficiency scoring
* carbon trace generation
* feedback into the Knowledge Graph

GreenCore ensures that every approved execution path is optimized before being carried out.

---

## 6. Routing Engine

The GreenCore Routing Engine determines the optimal execution environment for each task.

Execution targets include:

```text
local
edge
cloud
```

---

### 6.1 Routing Inputs

The Routing Engine evaluates:

* task type
* tenant ID
* decision ID
* PolicyCore status
* Domain Pack context
* data sensitivity
* required latency
* compute complexity
* estimated energy usage
* infrastructure availability
* tenant execution policy
* sovereignty requirements
* carbon tracking requirements

Example input:

```json
{
  "task_id": "task_001",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_001",
  "decision_id": "dec_001",
  "domain_pack": "finance_pack",
  "task_type": "financial_scenario_simulation",
  "data_sensitivity": "high",
  "latency_requirement": "medium",
  "compute_complexity": "high",
  "policy_status": "approved",
  "preferred_region": "EU",
  "tenant_policy": {
    "cloud_allowed": false,
    "edge_preferred": true
  }
}
```

---

### 6.2 Routing Outputs

GreenCore produces an execution routing decision.

Example output:

```json
{
  "routing_decision_id": "route_001",
  "task_id": "task_001",
  "routing_decision": "edge",
  "execution_zone": "EU_EDGE_NODE",
  "reason": "High data sensitivity + cloud not allowed + medium latency requirement.",
  "estimated_cost": "low",
  "estimated_carbon": "reduced",
  "sovereignty_score": 0.94,
  "audit_status": "traceable"
}
```

---

### 6.3 Routing Priority

GreenCore follows this priority order:

```text
1. PolicyCore status
2. Tenant execution policy
3. Data sensitivity
4. Sovereignty requirement
5. Latency requirement
6. Compute complexity
7. Carbon / cost optimization
8. Infrastructure availability
```

GreenCore cannot route execution if PolicyCore has rejected the decision.

---

## 7. Execution Modes

GreenCore supports three primary execution modes.

---

### 7.1 Local / On-Device Execution

Used when:

* data is highly sensitive
* cloud execution is forbidden
* latency must be minimal
* task complexity is low or moderate
* tenant policy requires local processing

Benefits:

* maximum sovereignty
* minimal data movement
* low latency
* reduced exposure
* lower carbon footprint for lightweight tasks

---

### 7.2 Edge Execution

Used when:

* moderate compute is required
* data should remain regionally constrained
* latency matters
* cloud execution is unnecessary or restricted
* tenant policy prefers sovereign distributed execution

Benefits:

* regional execution
* reduced cloud dependency
* lower network overhead
* stronger sovereignty posture
* balanced performance profile

---

### 7.3 EU Cloud Execution

Used when:

* high compute is required
* task complexity exceeds local or edge capability
* data can be anonymized or securely processed
* PolicyCore and tenant policies allow cloud execution
* EU-based infrastructure is available

Benefits:

* scalable compute
* complex simulation capacity
* fallback execution path
* controlled sovereign cloud processing

---

## 8. Carbon Intelligence System

The Carbon Intelligence System measures, estimates, and records the environmental footprint of QORWAY execution.

It tracks carbon impact across:

* tasks
* workflows
* agents
* tenants
* Domain Packs
* execution zones
* routing modes

---

### 8.1 What Carbon Intelligence Measures

Carbon Intelligence may track:

* estimated compute energy
* execution location
* workload intensity
* model usage
* network transfer cost
* carbon equivalent
* carbon avoided through routing decisions
* carbon per workflow
* carbon per tenant
* carbon per Domain Pack

---

### 8.2 Carbon Trace

Each execution can generate a carbon trace.

Example:

```json
{
  "carbon_trace_id": "co2_001",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_001",
  "decision_id": "dec_001",
  "workflow_id": "wf_001",
  "execution_zone": "EU_EDGE_NODE",
  "estimated_energy_kwh": 0.42,
  "estimated_co2e_kg": 0.018,
  "baseline_cloud_co2e_kg": 0.073,
  "estimated_savings_pct": 75.3
}
```

---

### 8.3 Strategic Role

Carbon Intelligence makes the environmental cost of intelligence visible.

It enables:

* ESG-aware execution
* CSRD-aligned IT carbon reporting
* tenant-level sustainability dashboards
* compute budget governance
* carbon-aware enterprise AI adoption
* feedback into execution routing

Core rule:

> Carbon Intelligence is not reporting only. It feeds future routing decisions.

---

## 9. Edge Execution Layer

The Edge Execution Layer enables QORWAY workloads to run closer to the data source.

It supports:

* lightweight agents
* preprocessing tasks
* local inference
* event filtering
* sensitive data handling
* reduced cloud dependency
* regional execution

---

### 9.1 Edge Use Cases

Edge execution is preferred for:

* preprocessing sensitive data
* lightweight event classification
* tenant-specific workflow checks
* local agent tasks
* filtering before cloud escalation
* first-pass reasoning for low-risk workloads
* execution in sovereignty-sensitive environments

---

### 9.2 Edge Flow

```text
PulseFlow execution request

GreenCore Routing Engine
  ↓
Edge Execution Layer
  ↓
Agent / workload execution
  ↓
Carbon trace generated
  ↓
Feedback to Knowledge Graph
```

---

### 9.3 Edge Constraints

Edge Execution must never:

* bypass tenant isolation
* process unauthorized data
* execute unvalidated decisions
* bypass PulseFlow audit logging
* override PolicyCore constraints
* remove audit metadata

---

## 10. Green Policy Engine

The Green Policy Engine defines execution policies for energy, compute, carbon, and sovereignty.

Green policies may define:

* local-first execution
* edge-preferred execution
* EU cloud only
* no cloud for sensitive data
* GPU usage limits
* carbon cap per workflow
* carbon tracking requirements
* tenant-specific execution preferences

---

### 10.1 Policy Levels

Green policies may exist at several levels:

```text
Global QORWAY policy
  ↓
Tenant policy
  ↓
Domain Pack policy
  ↓
Workflow policy
  ↓
Task policy
```

---

### 10.2 Example Policy

```json
{
  "policy_id": "green_policy_001",
  "scope": "tenant",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_001",
  "rule": "no_cloud_for_sensitive_data",
  "severity": "hard_block",
  "fallback": "edge",
  "applies_to": ["finance_pack", "risk_pack"]
}
```

---

### 10.3 Relationship with PolicyCore

Green policies must remain compatible with PolicyCore.

If a GreenCore policy creates a hard execution boundary, PolicyCore may use it as a constraint.

However:

> GreenCore cannot weaken or override PolicyCore constraints.

If PolicyCore blocks a decision, GreenCore cannot reroute it into execution.

---

## 11. Observability Layer

The GreenCore Observability Layer monitors execution efficiency across the QORWAY runtime.

It provides visibility into:

* routing decisions
* local vs edge vs cloud distribution
* compute cost
* carbon footprint
* latency
* tenant efficiency
* Domain Pack efficiency
* workflow efficiency
* agent efficiency
* sovereignty score

---

### 11.1 Core Metrics

GreenCore tracks:

* % local execution
* % edge execution
* % cloud execution
* estimated CO₂ saved
* compute cost saved
* average routing efficiency score
* carbon per workflow
* carbon per tenant
* carbon per Domain Pack
* latency by execution mode
* cloud fallback rate
* sovereignty score

---

### 11.2 Admin View

The admin view may show:

* global infrastructure distribution
* total CO₂ saved
* cost optimization trends
* cloud fallback rate
* infrastructure pressure points
* routing anomalies

---

### 11.3 Tenant View

The tenant view may show:

* execution efficiency score
* local / edge / cloud ratio
* estimated carbon savings
* compute cost savings
* sovereignty score
* policy compliance status

---

## 12. Relationship with Atlas

Atlas defines what should happen.

GreenCore does not change the causal decision.

However, GreenCore feedback can influence future Atlas recommendations by surfacing:

* high-cost workflows
* high-carbon workflows
* high-latency execution paths
* sovereignty-sensitive tasks
* inefficient execution patterns

Flow:

```text
Execution feedback
  ↓
GreenCore metrics
  ↓
Knowledge Graph update
  ↓
Future Atlas reasoning
```

Core rule:

> Atlas reasons about decisions. GreenCore informs future reasoning through execution efficiency feedback.

---

## 13. Relationship with Domain Packs

Domain Packs may define execution preferences used by GreenCore.

Example:

### ESG / CSRD Pack

* carbon tracking required
* green routing preferred
* ESG execution evidence required

### Finance Pack

* sensitive data must remain local or edge
* cloud execution only after anonymization
* execution must preserve audit trail

### Risk Pack

* high-risk workflows require strict execution boundaries
* cloud fallback may require human approval

Core rule:

> Domain Packs define execution preferences. GreenCore applies them within approved constraints.

---

## 14. Relationship with PolicyCore

PolicyCore is the constraint authority.

GreenCore is the optimization authority.

PolicyCore defines:

> What is allowed?

GreenCore defines:

> What is the best execution path for what is allowed?

GreenCore cannot:

* legalize rejected decisions
* override regulatory constraints
* bypass tenant policies
* ignore human oversight requirements
* route execution outside approved boundaries

---

## 15. Relationship with PulseFlow

PulseFlow orchestrates execution.

GreenCore optimizes execution routing.

```text
PulseFlow creates execution request
  ↓
GreenCore evaluates routing
  ↓
PulseFlow executes optimized route
```

PulseFlow remains responsible for:

* event lifecycle
* workflow orchestration
* agent activation
* execution logs
* feedback emission

GreenCore remains responsible for:

* routing decision
* compute optimization
* carbon estimation
* sovereignty scoring

---

## 16. Relationship with the Knowledge Graph

GreenCore writes execution optimization data back into the Knowledge Graph.

It may create or update:

* routing decisions
* execution zones
* cost estimates
* latency records
* carbon traces
* sovereignty scores
* efficiency signals

Example:

```text
Execution Task → ROUTED_BY → GreenCore Decision
GreenCore Decision → PRODUCED → Carbon Trace
Carbon Trace → UPDATES → Tenant Efficiency Profile
```

Core rule:

> GreenCore makes execution efficiency visible to the Knowledge Graph.

---

## 17. Feedback and Learning

GreenCore feedback may update:

* future routing decisions
* tenant execution policies
* Domain Pack execution preferences
* Atlas decision heuristics
* carbon baselines
* cost baselines
* infrastructure planning

GreenCore does not create uncontrolled learning.

All policy changes must remain governed, tenant-scoped, and auditable.

---

## 18. Reliability Requirements

GreenCore must guarantee:

* deterministic routing decisions
* full routing traceability
* tenant-scoped execution policies
* PolicyCore compatibility
* fallback execution paths
* carbon trace persistence
* no silent routing changes
* no execution outside approved boundaries

Every routing decision must be explainable.

---

## 19. Security & Governance

GreenCore must enforce:

* tenant execution boundaries
* data sensitivity rules
* approved execution zones
* encrypted transport where required
* carbon trace integrity
* routing audit logs
* no unauthorized cloud escalation

GreenCore must operate within the full QORWAY governance model.

---

## 20. System Constraints

GreenCore must never:

* execute decisions directly
* bypass PulseFlow
* override PolicyCore
* weaken tenant policies
* process unauthorized data
* hide carbon or cost impact
* route sensitive workloads outside approved boundaries
* remove audit metadata from execution logs
* silently change routing behavior without traceability

---

## 21. What GreenCore Replaces

GreenCore replaces fragmented approaches to:

* cloud cost management
* manual compute routing
* carbon reporting disconnected from execution
* sustainability dashboards without runtime enforcement
* FinOps without causal intelligence
* local vs cloud execution decisions made ad hoc

GreenCore turns execution optimization into a native runtime capability.

---

## 22. Strategic Importance

GreenCore gives QORWAY a unique strategic position.

Traditional AI systems optimize for:

* model performance
* output quality
* speed

QORWAY optimizes for:

* decision quality
* execution feasibility
* compute cost
* latency
* carbon footprint
* sovereignty
* auditability

This makes GreenCore critical for:

* European enterprise adoption
* public-sector trust
* CSRD-aligned intelligence systems
* sovereign AI infrastructure
* cost-controlled AI deployment
* sustainable AI execution

---

## 23. Final Definition

GreenCore™ is the execution optimization layer of QORWAY.

It routes validated workloads across local, edge, and cloud environments while optimizing for cost, latency, carbon footprint, and sovereignty.

Final system statement:

> GreenCore is where QORWAY makes execution efficient, sovereign, and sustainable by design.
