# PulseFlow Overview

**QORWAY Execution Orchestration Layer**

> PulseFlow turns validated intelligence into governed execution.

---

## 1. Definition

PulseFlow is the event-driven execution orchestration layer of QORWAY.

It transforms PolicyCore-validated Atlas decisions into:

- execution events
- workflows
- agent tasks
- system actions
- audit logs
- feedback signals

PulseFlow is the nervous system of QORWAY.

It ensures that decisions do not remain static recommendations, but become traceable actions inside enterprise systems.

---

## 2. Role in QORWAY OS

PulseFlow exists to close the gap between intelligence and execution.

Most enterprise systems can produce:

- reports
- insights
- recommendations
- dashboards
- strategic plans

But they fail when those decisions must become coordinated action across systems, teams, agents, and workflows.

PulseFlow solves this by converting approved decisions into governed execution flows.

It connects:

```text
decision → event → workflow → action → outcome → feedback
````

---

## 3. Architecture Position

PulseFlow sits after PolicyCore and before GreenCore.

```text
ATLAS
  ↓
DOMAIN PACKS
  ↓
POLICYCORE
  ↓
PULSEFLOW
  ↓
GREENCORE
  ↓
AGENT / SYSTEM EXECUTION
  ↓
FEEDBACK LOOP
```

Layer responsibilities:

* Atlas reasons.
* Domain Packs contextualize.
* PolicyCore validates.
* PulseFlow orchestrates.
* GreenCore optimizes execution.
* Agents and systems execute.
* Feedback updates the Knowledge Graph.

PulseFlow does not decide whether a decision is correct or allowed.

It executes what has been validated.

---

## 4. Core Responsibilities

PulseFlow is responsible for:

* event creation
* event ingestion
* event normalization
* event enrichment
* workflow orchestration
* agent activation
* system coordination
* execution tracking
* outcome capture
* feedback emission
* audit-ready execution logging

PulseFlow ensures that every validated decision has an execution path.

---

## 5. What PulseFlow Is Not

PulseFlow is not:

* a causal reasoning engine
* a compliance authority
* a Domain Pack
* a compute optimization engine
* a dashboard
* a simple automation tool
* a generic event bus

PulseFlow is an execution orchestration system.

It is event-driven, governed, tenant-scoped, and feedback-aware.

---

## 6. Why Event-Driven Execution Matters

Enterprises behave like asynchronous systems.

Events occur continuously across:

* finance
* operations
* supply chain
* compliance
* ESG
* risk
* customer activity
* human decisions
* external regulation

Traditional systems often process these signals too late or too separately.

PulseFlow treats events as the operational language of the enterprise.

This allows QORWAY to maintain state coherence across fragmented systems.

---

## 7. PulseFlow Event Model

A PulseFlow event is the atomic execution unit of QORWAY.

Every event must include:

* event ID
* tenant ID
* event type
* source layer
* decision reference
* causal chain reference where applicable
* PolicyCore validation status where applicable
* Domain Pack reference
* priority
* timestamp
* audit metadata

Example:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_001",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_001",
  "event_type": "decision.execution.requested",
  "source_layer": "policycore",
  "decision_id": "dec_001",
  "domain_pack": "supply_chain_pack",
  "domain_pack_version": "1.0.0",
  "policy_status": "approved",
  "causal_chain_id": "chain_042",
  "execution_target": "agent_runtime",
  "priority": "high",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-05T10:00:00Z",
  "audit_status": "traceable"
}
```

An event is invalid if it lacks tenant scope or audit traceability.

---

## 8. Event Lifecycle

A PulseFlow event follows a governed lifecycle:

```text
1. Event created
2. Event validated
3. Event normalized
4. Event enriched with context
5. Event routed
6. Workflow compiled
7. Agent / system activated
8. Execution tracked
9. Outcome emitted
10. Feedback stored
11. Knowledge Graph updated
```

This lifecycle ensures that execution is observable, replayable, and auditable.

---

## 9. Decision-to-Execution Flow

PulseFlow receives validated decisions and converts them into execution flows.

```text
PolicyCore-approved decision
  ↓
PulseFlow event creation
  ↓
workflow orchestration
  ↓
agent / system execution
  ↓
outcome event
  ↓
feedback signal
```

PulseFlow’s role is not to decide what should happen.

Its role is to move validated decisions through the enterprise safely and coherently.

---

## 10. Relationship with Atlas

Atlas produces structured causal decisions.

PulseFlow receives validated decisions and turns them into execution events.

Atlas answers:

> What should happen?

PulseFlow answers:

> How does this move through systems?

Atlas cannot execute directly.

Every execution path must pass through PulseFlow.

---

## 11. Relationship with Domain Packs

Domain Packs define the domain-specific execution context.

They may define:

* available actions
* gates
* dependencies
* expected events
* workflow templates
* outcome structures
* feedback rules

PulseFlow uses these definitions to understand how a decision should become action inside a specific domain.

Example:

```text
ESG / CSRD Domain Pack
  ↓
ACT_E1_001 = Carbon assessment
  ↓
esg.action.carbon_assessment.requested
  ↓
PulseFlow workflow
```

Core rule:

> Domain Packs define the paths. PulseFlow executes the paths.

---

## 12. Relationship with PolicyCore

PolicyCore validates whether a decision can move forward.

PulseFlow can only execute decisions that are:

* APPROVED
* MODIFIED AND APPROVED

PulseFlow must never execute:

* rejected decisions
* unvalidated decisions
* decisions without causal lineage
* decisions without tenant scope
* decisions missing required human approval

Core rule:

> No PulseFlow execution can occur without PolicyCore validation.

If PolicyCore returns:

```text
REJECTED
```

PulseFlow stops execution.

If PolicyCore returns:

```text
MODIFIED
```

PulseFlow executes only the validated modified path.

If PolicyCore returns:

```text
APPROVED
```

PulseFlow orchestrates execution.

---

## 13. Relationship with GreenCore

GreenCore optimizes execution after PulseFlow creates the execution request.

PulseFlow determines:

> What must be executed?

GreenCore determines:

> Where and how should it execute optimally?

GreenCore evaluates:

* local execution
* edge execution
* cloud execution
* cost
* latency
* carbon footprint
* sovereignty constraints
* tenant execution policies

Flow:

```text
PulseFlow execution request
  ↓
GreenCore routing decision
  ↓
agent / system execution
```

GreenCore cannot override PolicyCore.

GreenCore optimizes only valid execution paths.

---

## 14. Relationship with the Knowledge Graph

PulseFlow turns execution into system memory.

It emits and records events that update the Knowledge Graph.

Examples:

```text
decision.execution.requested
workflow.started
workflow.completed
action.failed
outcome.observed
feedback.generated
diagnostic.signal.generated
```

These events may update:

* decision status
* action status
* risk state
* gate state
* outcome evidence
* causal confidence
* feedback records

Core rule:

> PulseFlow turns reality into graph memory.

---

## 15. Agent Orchestration

PulseFlow activates and coordinates bounded agents.

Agents may include:

* monitoring agents
* validation agents
* execution agents
* reporting agents
* feedback agents

PulseFlow determines:

* which agent is activated
* which event triggers activation
* what context the agent receives
* what output the agent must return
* how the result is logged

Every agent action must produce an event.

Agents cannot bypass PulseFlow.

---

## 16. Workflow Orchestration

PulseFlow compiles validated decisions into workflows.

A workflow may include:

* task creation
* system update
* human approval
* agent execution
* API call
* notification
* reporting output
* follow-up event
* rollback path where possible

Workflows must be:

* tenant-scoped
* idempotent
* auditable
* replayable where required
* linked to a validated decision

A workflow is invalid if it cannot be traced.

---

## 17. Feedback Loop

PulseFlow is responsible for generating execution feedback.

Feedback may include:

* actual outcome
* expected vs actual delta
* execution delay
* financial impact
* operational impact
* compliance result
* carbon / compute impact
* human approval outcome

Feedback events update:

* the Knowledge Graph
* Atlas confidence scores
* causal weights
* Domain Pack feedback rules
* future decision heuristics

Without PulseFlow, QORWAY reasons.

With PulseFlow, QORWAY acts, observes, and learns.

---

## 18. Reliability Requirements

PulseFlow must guarantee:

* deterministic event handling
* event persistence
* idempotent execution
* replay capability
* tenant isolation
* failure containment
* retry logic
* dead letter handling
* correlation IDs
* audit-ready logging

Recommended technical patterns:

* Outbox Pattern
* AsyncAPI contracts
* Dead Letter Queue
* Event Replay
* Correlation ID propagation
* Idempotent consumers

No event should be processed without a traceable execution path.

---

## 19. Security & Governance

PulseFlow operates under strict governance rules.

Every event must be:

* tenant-scoped
* authenticated
* authorized
* encrypted in transit
* logged
* replayable where required
* auditable

PulseFlow must enforce:

* event-level access control
* no cross-tenant leakage
* immutable execution logs
* human override where required
* PolicyCore validation before execution

---

## 20. System Constraints

PulseFlow must never:

* execute decisions without PolicyCore validation
* execute rejected decisions
* bypass tenant isolation
* reason independently from Atlas
* modify causal logic
* override GreenCore routing decisions
* emit unaudited execution events
* call external systems without authorization
* process events without correlation ID
* allow agents to execute outside approved boundaries

---

## 21. What PulseFlow Replaces

Traditional enterprise execution often looks like:

```text
recommendation → manual workflow → fragmented action → weak feedback
```

PulseFlow enables:

```text
validated decision → governed event → orchestrated execution → feedback learning
```

It replaces disconnected workflows with a governed execution nervous system.

---

## 22. Strategic Importance

PulseFlow transforms QORWAY from a reasoning infrastructure into an operational infrastructure.

It enables QORWAY to move from:

```text
intelligence output
```

to:

```text
governed execution system
```

This is the difference between AI that recommends and infrastructure that acts.

PulseFlow is central to QORWAY’s ability to deliver:

* execution traceability
* real-time synchronization
* agent coordination
* enterprise system integration
* closed-loop learning
* audit-ready decision execution

---

## 23. Final Definition

PulseFlow is the event-driven execution orchestration layer of QORWAY.

It transforms PolicyCore-validated Atlas decisions into synchronized actions, agent workflows, execution logs, and feedback signals across enterprise systems.

Final system statement:

> PulseFlow is where QORWAY intelligence becomes governed execution.
