# PolicyCore Overview

**QORWAY Constraint Validation Layer**

> PolicyCore ensures that intelligence is not only powerful, but valid, compliant, safe, and executable in the real world.

---

## 1. Definition

PolicyCore is the constraint validation layer of QORWAY.

It evaluates whether a causal decision produced by Atlas, contextualized by Domain Packs, can be approved, modified, or rejected before execution.

PolicyCore answers one question:

> Is this decision allowed to exist?

It does not generate decisions.

It does not execute workflows.

It does not optimize compute.

It validates whether a decision can move forward under regulatory, financial, ESG, ethical, operational, and tenant-specific constraints.

---

## 2. Role in QORWAY OS

PolicyCore exists to prevent uncontrolled intelligence.

Enterprise AI systems fail when:

- compliance is applied after the fact
- decisions are not auditable
- constraints are external to reasoning
- risk is reactive instead of embedded
- human oversight is inconsistent
- execution happens before validation

QORWAY reverses this pattern.

PolicyCore embeds constraints directly into the decision runtime.

Core rule:

> No decision becomes executable unless PolicyCore validates it.

---

## 3. Architecture Position

PolicyCore sits after Atlas and Domain Packs, and before PulseFlow.

```text
ATLAS
  ↓
DOMAIN PACKS
  ↓
POLICYCORE
  ↓
PULSEFLOW
  ↓
GREENCORE
  ↓
EXECUTION
  ↓
FEEDBACK LOOP
````

Layer responsibilities:

* Atlas reasons.
* Domain Packs contextualize.
* PolicyCore validates.
* PulseFlow orchestrates.
* GreenCore optimizes execution.
* Agents and systems execute.

PolicyCore is the gate between intelligence and execution.

---

## 4. Core Responsibilities

PolicyCore is responsible for:

* validating decisions before execution
* enforcing regulatory constraints
* enforcing ESG and sustainability constraints
* enforcing financial exposure limits
* enforcing ethical and human oversight rules
* enforcing tenant-specific policies
* producing constraint evaluation results
* generating compliance traces
* blocking invalid execution paths
* modifying decisions where permitted
* ensuring audit-ready governance evidence

PolicyCore turns constraints into computable decision rules.

---

## 5. What PolicyCore Is Not

PolicyCore is not:

* an ESG dashboard
* a reporting module
* a compliance checklist
* a legal advisor
* an execution engine
* a workflow orchestrator
* a compute optimization layer

PolicyCore is a runtime constraint intelligence system.

It validates decisions before they become real-world actions.

---

## 6. Constraint Domains

PolicyCore evaluates decisions across five primary constraint domains.

---

### 6.1 Regulatory Constraints

Examples:

* GDPR requirements
* EU AI Act requirements
* data usage restrictions
* explainability requirements
* auditability requirements
* transparency requirements
* sector-specific regulation

---

### 6.2 ESG / Sustainability Constraints

Examples:

* carbon intensity thresholds
* supplier compliance scoring
* environmental impact caps
* sustainability risk propagation
* CSRD / ESRS alignment requirements
* Scope 3 exposure limits

---

### 6.3 Financial Constraints

Examples:

* capital exposure limits
* liquidity safety thresholds
* ROI floor requirements
* risk-adjusted capital rules
* budget ceilings
* margin protection rules

---

### 6.4 Ethical Constraints

Examples:

* fairness rules
* bias thresholds
* human override requirements
* sensitive domain restrictions
* citizen / customer impact limits
* employee impact constraints

---

### 6.5 System Constraints

Examples:

* operational capacity limits
* execution bandwidth constraints
* agent overload protection
* dependency saturation rules
* system availability constraints
* tenant policy limits

---

## 7. PolicyCore Decision Outcomes

PolicyCore may return three primary outcomes:

```text
APPROVED
MODIFIED
REJECTED
```

---

### APPROVED

The decision satisfies all required constraints and can move to PulseFlow execution.

---

### MODIFIED

The decision is valid only under an adjusted execution or decision path.

Example:

```text
Allowed only with human approval.
Allowed only under reduced exposure.
Allowed only through EU execution zone.
Allowed only after data anonymization.
```

---

### REJECTED

The decision violates a hard constraint and cannot move to execution.

Example:

```text
Rejected because it violates tenant policy.
Rejected because data cannot leave approved boundary.
Rejected because financial exposure exceeds threshold.
Rejected because required human oversight is missing.
```

---

## 8. PolicyCore Data Model

A PolicyCore constraint may be represented as:

```json
{
  "constraint_id": "CONSTRAINT_MAX_CARBON_INTENSITY",
  "constraint": "max_carbon_intensity",
  "scope": "supply_chain",
  "threshold": 0.7,
  "severity": "hard_block",
  "enforcement": "pre_execution",
  "linked_domain": "supply_chain_pack"
}
```

A PolicyCore evaluation result may be represented as:

```json
{
  "policycore_result_id": "pol_001",
  "decision_id": "dec_001",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_001",
  "status": "MODIFIED",
  "constraints_checked": [
    "gdpr_data_scope",
    "financial_exposure_limit",
    "max_carbon_intensity"
  ],
  "modifications_required": [
    "execute_on_edge",
    "require_human_approval"
  ],
  "audit_status": "traceable"
}
```

---

## 9. Constraint Types

PolicyCore supports several constraint types.

| Constraint Type         | Behavior                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Hard Block              | Execution forbidden                 |
| Soft Limit              | Warning + degraded execution        |
| Modification Rule       | Decision must be adjusted           |
| Human Approval          | Execution requires human validation |
| Simulation Constraint   | Affects scenario outcomes           |
| Optimization Constraint | Influences GreenCore routing        |

---

## 10. PolicyCore × Atlas

Atlas proposes decisions.

PolicyCore validates whether those decisions can exist in the real world.

```text
Atlas decision
  ↓
PolicyCore evaluation
  ↓
Approved / Modified / Rejected
```

Example:

```text
Atlas:
Increasing pricing by 8% may improve revenue by 12%.

PolicyCore:
Modified — allowed only for non-regulated customer segments and after fairness constraint check.
```

Core rule:

> Atlas can propose. PolicyCore decides what is allowed.

Atlas cannot override PolicyCore.

If PolicyCore rejects a decision, Atlas must generate an alternative path or explain why the decision is blocked.

---

## 11. PolicyCore × Domain Packs

Domain Packs provide domain-specific rules, evidence requirements, gates, risks, and constraints.

PolicyCore uses Domain Pack context to validate decisions within a specific domain.

Example:

```text
Finance Pack
  ↓
capital exposure rules
  ↓
PolicyCore validates allocation decision
```

Example:

```text
ESG / CSRD Pack
  ↓
carbon thresholds + ESRS evidence requirements
  ↓
PolicyCore validates sustainability decision
```

Core rule:

> Domain Packs structure domain logic. PolicyCore validates real-world constraints.

---

## 12. PolicyCore × PulseFlow

PulseFlow can execute only PolicyCore-approved decisions.

```text
PolicyCore result
  ↓
PulseFlow execution request
```

PulseFlow must never execute:

* rejected decisions
* unvalidated decisions
* decisions without causal lineage
* decisions outside tenant boundaries
* decisions missing required human approval

Core rule:

> No PulseFlow execution can occur without PolicyCore validation.

---

## 13. PolicyCore × GreenCore

PolicyCore defines what is allowed.

GreenCore defines the best way to execute what is allowed.

```text
PolicyCore approved path
  ↓
GreenCore execution optimization
```

GreenCore cannot:

* legalize rejected decisions
* override regulatory constraints
* bypass tenant policies
* ignore human oversight requirements
* route execution outside approved boundaries

Core rule:

> GreenCore optimizes only paths that PolicyCore has approved.

---

## 14. PolicyCore × Knowledge Graph

PolicyCore uses graph context to validate decisions.

It may evaluate:

* active risks
* constraint nodes
* regulatory references
* causal chains
* tenant policies
* evidence nodes
* human approval requirements

PolicyCore also writes results back to the Knowledge Graph.

Example relationships:

```text
Decision → CHECKED_BY → PolicyCore Result
PolicyCore Result → BLOCKS → Execution Event
PolicyCore Result → EVIDENCES → Audit Trail
```

This ensures constraint validation is graph-linked and audit-ready.

---

## 15. Human-in-the-Loop Governance

PolicyCore can require human approval before execution.

Human approval may be required when:

* financial exposure exceeds threshold
* regulatory sensitivity is high
* tenant policy requires review
* public interest is affected
* human impact is material
* system confidence is below threshold
* simulation drift exceeds allowed tolerance

Example human approval requirement:

```json
{
  "constraint": "human_approval_required",
  "scope": "capital_allocation",
  "required_role": "CFO",
  "severity": "hard_block",
  "enforcement": "pre_execution"
}
```

No execution may proceed until the required approval is logged.

---

## 16. Compliance Trace Log

Every PolicyCore evaluation must produce a compliance trace.

A trace should include:

* decision ID
* tenant ID
* Domain Pack name and version
* causal chain reference
* constraints checked
* constraint results
* approval status
* modification requirements
* human approval requirements
* timestamp
* audit metadata

A decision is invalid if PolicyCore validation cannot be reconstructed.

---

## 17. PolicyCore Outputs

PolicyCore produces four primary outputs.

---

### 17.1 Constraint Pass / Fail Matrix

Shows which constraints passed, failed, or required modification.

---

### 17.2 Risk-Adjusted Decision Graph

A constrained version of the Atlas decision graph.

It shows how constraints reshape, block, or modify decision paths.

---

### 17.3 Compliance Trace Log

The audit-ready record of why a decision was approved, modified, or rejected.

---

### 17.4 Constraint Impact Score

Measures how constraints reduce, reshape, or redirect potential value creation.

---

## 18. Feedback and Learning

PolicyCore outcomes become part of the feedback loop.

Feedback may include:

* blocked decision frequency
* most common constraint violations
* human approval delays
* regulatory risk concentration
* ESG threshold breaches
* financial exposure rejections
* system capacity bottlenecks

This feedback can update:

* Domain Pack constraints
* tenant policy settings
* Atlas recommendation patterns
* risk thresholds
* governance dashboards

PolicyCore does not learn uncontrolled behavior.

All updates must remain governed and auditable.

---

## 19. System Constraints

PolicyCore must never:

* execute decisions directly
* generate decisions independently from Atlas
* bypass tenant boundaries
* weaken regulatory constraints
* ignore Domain Pack evidence requirements
* approve decisions without causal lineage
* silently modify decisions without trace
* let PulseFlow execute rejected decisions
* allow GreenCore to override hard constraints

---

## 20. What PolicyCore Replaces

Traditional enterprise systems handle governance like this:

```text
decision → execution → reporting → audit reconstruction
```

PolicyCore enables:

```text
decision → constraint validation → governed execution → audit evidence
```

It replaces post-hoc compliance with runtime governance.

---

## 21. Strategic Importance

PolicyCore is one of QORWAY’s strongest defensibility layers.

Competitors can build:

* dashboards
* agents
* workflow automations
* LLM interfaces
* analytics systems

But real-time multi-dimensional constraint computation embedded into causal decision infrastructure is much harder to replicate.

PolicyCore makes QORWAY deployable in:

* regulated enterprises
* public institutions
* ESG-sensitive environments
* financial decision systems
* risk-heavy operational domains
* AI Act-relevant contexts

It turns compliance from a reporting burden into a runtime capability.

---

## 22. Final Definition

PolicyCore is the constraint validation layer of QORWAY.

It ensures that every causal decision remains legally, financially, ethically, operationally, and systemically valid before execution.

Final system statement:

> PolicyCore is where intelligence becomes safe enough to execute.
