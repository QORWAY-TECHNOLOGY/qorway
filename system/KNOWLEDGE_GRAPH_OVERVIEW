# Knowledge Graph Overview

**QORWAY System Memory & Causal Structure Layer**

> The Knowledge Graph is how QORWAY represents organizational reality as a causal system.

---

## 1. Definition

The Knowledge Graph is the structured memory layer of QORWAY.

It models an organization as a network of:

- entities
- indicators
- actions
- risks
- gates
- constraints
- decisions
- events
- outcomes
- feedback signals

The Knowledge Graph gives Atlas the structured context required to reason causally.

Without the Knowledge Graph, Atlas becomes generic.

With the Knowledge Graph, Atlas becomes system-aware.

---

## 2. Role in QORWAY OS

The Knowledge Graph exists to answer one foundational question:

> What exists inside the system, how is it connected, and what has happened before?

It provides:

- organizational memory
- causal structure
- decision lineage
- dependency mapping
- risk propagation logic
- evidence for auditability
- feedback integration

The Knowledge Graph is not only a data model.

It is the system representation of the organization.

---

## 3. Architecture Position

The Knowledge Graph sits between enterprise data ingestion and Atlas reasoning.

```text
ENTERPRISE DATA

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
  ↓
ATLAS
  ↓
DOMAIN PACKS
  ↓
POLICYCORE
  ↓
PULSEFLOW
  ↓
GREENCORE
  ↓
EXECUTION
  ↓
FEEDBACK LOOP
````

Enterprise data updates the graph.

Atlas reasons over the graph.

PulseFlow and GreenCore generate feedback that updates the graph again.

---

## 4. Core Responsibilities

The Knowledge Graph is responsible for:

* representing domain and tenant reality
* storing causal relationships
* linking decisions to evidence
* tracking dependencies between systems
* storing past decisions and outcomes
* supporting risk propagation modeling
* enabling explainable decision paths
* integrating execution feedback into future reasoning

The Knowledge Graph ensures that QORWAY reasons over structured reality, not disconnected data.

---

## 5. Graph Composition

The Knowledge Graph is composed of nodes and relationships.

### Typical Node Types

* Indicator
* Action
* Risk
* Gate
* Outcome
* Constraint
* Event
* Decision
* Actor
* System
* Resource
* Tenant
* Workflow
* Evidence

### Typical Relationship Types

* CAUSES
* MITIGATES
* REQUIRES
* BLOCKS
* ENABLES
* AFFECTS
* TRIGGERS
* DEPENDS_ON
* EVIDENCES
* EXECUTED_BY
* OBSERVED_AS
* UPDATED_BY

Example:

```text
Indicator → CAUSES → Risk
Action → MITIGATES → Risk
Gate → BLOCKS → Outcome
Decision → TRIGGERS → Event
Outcome → UPDATED_BY → Feedback
```

---

## 6. Universal vs Private Graphs

QORWAY uses two complementary graph levels:

```text
Universal Knowledge Graph
  ↓
Private Tenant Knowledge Graph
```

This separation is essential for scalability, sovereignty, and trust.

---

## 7. Universal Knowledge Graph

The Universal Knowledge Graph contains reusable non-identifiable domain structures.

It may contain:

* generic domain ontologies
* standard causal patterns
* common risk structures
* public regulatory logic
* reusable decision templates
* anonymized abstractions where governance allows

It must never contain:

* private tenant data
* proprietary workflows
* identifiable business relationships
* sensitive operating structures
* raw customer data

Purpose:

> The Universal Knowledge Graph provides reusable intelligence without compromising tenant sovereignty.

---

## 8. Private Tenant Knowledge Graph

The Private Tenant Knowledge Graph represents a specific organization’s reality.

It may contain:

* tenant-specific decisions
* internal systems
* private workflows
* proprietary causal relationships
* organization-specific risks
* operational dependencies
* execution history
* feedback records

It is:

* tenant-isolated
* encrypted
* access-controlled
* non-transferable
* never merged into another tenant graph

Purpose:

> The Private Tenant Knowledge Graph models the sovereign causal reality of one organization.

---

## 9. Relationship with Atlas

Atlas uses the Knowledge Graph to reason.

Atlas may query or traverse the graph to identify:

* causal chains
* risk activation paths
* missing data
* blocked gates
* dependency conflicts
* decision options
* impact propagation
* explanation paths

Flow:

```text
Knowledge Graph state
  ↓
Atlas traversal
  ↓
causal chain extraction
  ↓
decision option generation
  ↓
explainable recommendation
```

Core rule:

> Atlas cannot produce valid decisions without graph-backed causal lineage.

---

## 10. Relationship with Domain Packs

Domain Packs define the reusable graph structure for a specific domain.

A Domain Pack may provide:

* node types
* relationship types
* causal rules
* indicators
* actions
* risks
* gates
* outcomes
* events
* feedback rules
* systemic impact model

When instantiated, a Domain Pack enriches the Knowledge Graph.

```text

Graph schema
  ↓
Tenant graph instantiation
  ↓
Atlas domain-aware reasoning
```

Core rule:

> Domain Packs define the domain structure. The Knowledge Graph stores the active system state.

---

## 11. Relationship with PolicyCore

PolicyCore uses graph context to validate decisions.

It may rely on graph data such as:

* active risks
* regulatory constraints
* tenant policies
* causal pathways
* evidence nodes
* human approval requirements
* decision lineage

PolicyCore adds constraint evaluation results back into the graph.

Example:

```text
Decision → CHECKED_BY → PolicyCore Result
PolicyCore Result → BLOCKS → Execution Event
PolicyCore Result → EVIDENCES → Audit Trail
```

Core rule:

> Constraint validation must be graph-linkable and audit-ready.

---

## 12. Relationship with PulseFlow

PulseFlow updates the Knowledge Graph through execution events.

Examples of PulseFlow events:

* decision.execution.requested
* workflow.started
* workflow.completed
* action.failed
* outcome.observed
* feedback.generated
* diagnostic.signal.generated

These events may update:

* decision status
* action status
* risk state
* gate state
* outcome evidence
* feedback records

Core rule:

> PulseFlow turns execution into graph memory.

---

## 13. Relationship with GreenCore

GreenCore contributes execution optimization data to the Knowledge Graph.

It may create or update:

* routing decisions
* execution zones
* cost estimates
* latency records
* carbon traces
* sovereignty scores
* efficiency signals

This allows Atlas and future Domain Pack logic to learn from execution efficiency.

Example:

```text
Execution Task → ROUTED_BY → GreenCore Decision
GreenCore Decision → PRODUCED → Carbon Trace
Carbon Trace → UPDATES → Tenant Efficiency Profile
```

Core rule:

> GreenCore makes execution efficiency visible to the Knowledge Graph.

---

## 14. Graph-Backed Explainability

Every QORWAY decision must be explainable through graph structure.

A decision explanation may include:

* source signal
* active indicator
* causal rule
* risk node
* action node
* gate node
* PolicyCore result
* execution event
* feedback outcome

Example explanation path:

```text
supplier_delay_detected
  ↓
inventory_pressure
  ↓
margin_degradation
  ↓
supplier_risk_activated
  ↓
reroute_supplier_allocation
  ↓
expected_margin_recovery
```

A decision is invalid if this path cannot be reconstructed.

---

## 15. Feedback Integration

Feedback is reinjected into the Knowledge Graph after execution.

Feedback may include:

* actual outcome
* expected vs actual delta
* financial deviation
* operational deviation
* compliance result
* carbon impact
* execution delay
* human approval outcome
* diagnostic signal

Feedback may update:

* causal weights
* confidence scores
* risk patterns
* gate conditions
* decision heuristics
* Domain Pack refinement suggestions

Core rule:

> The Knowledge Graph is continuously updated by reality.

---

## 16. Data Classification

Graph data must be classified.

Recommended classifications:

```text
UNIVERSAL
PRIVATE
SENSITIVE
REGULATED
```

### UNIVERSAL

Reusable non-identifiable domain structure.

### PRIVATE

Tenant-specific organizational data.

### SENSITIVE

Confidential or high-risk tenant data requiring enhanced controls.

### REGULATED

Data subject to legal, sectoral, or jurisdictional constraints.

Each classification determines access, routing, logging, and export rules.

---

## 17. Tenant Isolation

Private Tenant Knowledge Graphs must be strictly isolated.

Isolation requirements:

* tenant-scoped graph namespaces
* access control at node and relationship level
* no cross-tenant traversal
* no inference leakage
* encryption where required
* audit logs for all sensitive graph access

Core rule:

> One tenant’s graph must never become another tenant’s intelligence.

---

## 18. Graph Governance

The Knowledge Graph must be governed.

Governance requirements:

* versioned graph schema
* controlled Domain Pack updates
* audit logs for graph mutations
* validation for causal rule changes
* no orphan critical nodes
* no risks without mitigation paths
* no decisions without causal lineage
* no outcomes without feedback reference

Graph changes must be traceable.

---

## 19. Graph Validation Rules

A graph state is invalid if:

* it contains orphan critical nodes
* it has risks without mitigation paths
* it has decisions without causal chains
* it has outcomes without feedback events
* it contains private tenant data in universal space
* it allows unauthorized traversal
* it cannot support audit reconstruction
* it breaks Domain Pack schema compatibility

---

## 20. Example Graph Pattern

Example supply chain decision pattern:

```text
Supplier Delay
  → CAUSES
Inventory Pressure
  → AFFECTS
Margin Stability
  → TRIGGERS
Supplier Risk
  → REQUIRES
Rerouting Decision
  → PRODUCES
Execution Workflow
  → OBSERVED_AS
Outcome Feedback
```

This pattern allows QORWAY to understand why a supply chain event matters, what decision should be considered, how execution should happen, and what learning should be captured.

---

## 21. What the Knowledge Graph Is Not

The Knowledge Graph is not:

* a traditional database
* a static ontology
* a reporting schema
* a dashboard backend
* a free-form memory store
* a generic vector database

It is the causal system memory of QORWAY.

---

## 22. Strategic Importance

The Knowledge Graph is one of QORWAY’s core strategic assets.

It enables:

* causal reasoning
* domain-aware decision generation
* tenant-specific intelligence
* audit-ready explanations
* risk propagation modeling
* feedback-driven learning
* scalable Domain Pack deployment

Without it, QORWAY would be a workflow system.

With it, QORWAY becomes decision intelligence infrastructure.

---

## 23. Final Definition

The Knowledge Graph is the structured causal memory of QORWAY.

It represents organizational reality, stores decision lineage, connects execution feedback to future reasoning, and enables Atlas to produce explainable decisions.

Final system statement:

> The Knowledge Graph is where QORWAY remembers, connects, and learns from organizational reality.
