# QORWAY Architecture

**Sovereign Decision Intelligence Infrastructure for Europe**

> From fragmented enterprise systems  
> → to causal, constrained, executable intelligence.

---

## 1. Architecture Purpose

QORWAY is designed to transform organizational decision-making into a structured, governed, and executable system.

It connects:

- enterprise data
- causal reasoning
- domain-specific intelligence
- constraint validation
- execution orchestration
- runtime optimization
- feedback learning

The objective is not to create another SaaS layer.

The objective is to create a **decision infrastructure runtime**.

---

## 2. Core Architecture

QORWAY operates as a 5-layer decision intelligence infrastructure:

```text
1. Atlas        → Causal Intelligence Engine
2. Domain Packs → Context & Business Intelligence Layer
3. PolicyCore   → Constraint Validation Layer
4. PulseFlow    → Execution Orchestration Layer
5. GreenCore    → Execution Optimization Layer
```

Each layer has a distinct responsibility.

No layer replaces another.

---

## 3. System Flow

```text
DATA
↓
KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
↓
ATLAS
↓
DOMAIN PACKS
↓
POLICYCORE
↓
DECISION
↓
PULSEFLOW
↓
GREENCORE
↓
EXECUTION
↓
FEEDBACK LOOP
```

This is the core QORWAY loop.

Every decision must move through reasoning, context, validation, execution, optimization, and feedback.

---

## 4. Layer 1 — Atlas

### Causal Intelligence Engine

Atlas is the reasoning core of QORWAY.

It transforms enterprise state into causal decision structures.

Atlas does not generate generic content.

It produces:

* causal chains
* decision recommendations
* impact simulations
* prioritized actions
* explanation paths

Atlas answers:

> What should happen?

---

## 5. Layer 2 — Domain Packs

### Context & Business Intelligence Layer

Domain Packs inject domain-specific intelligence into Atlas.

A Domain Pack contains:

* Knowledge Graph structure
* causal rules
* indicators
* actions
* risks
* gates
* outcomes
* templates

Domain Packs make Atlas operational in a specific business domain without fine-tuning or training data.

Examples:

* Finance Pack
* ESG / CSRD Pack
* Risk Pack
* Growth Pack
* Governance Pack

Domain Packs answer:

> How does this domain work structurally?

---

## 6. Layer 3 — PolicyCore

### Constraint Validation Layer

PolicyCore validates whether a causal decision can exist in the real world.

It evaluates decisions against:

* regulatory constraints
* ESG constraints
* financial constraints
* ethical constraints
* system constraints
* tenant-specific policies

PolicyCore can return:

```text
APPROVED
MODIFIED
REJECTED
```

PolicyCore answers:

> Is this allowed to exist?

No decision can move to execution without PolicyCore validation.

---

## 7. Layer 4 — PulseFlow

### Execution Orchestration Layer

PulseFlow transforms validated decisions into execution events.

It orchestrates:

* events
* workflows
* agents
* enterprise systems
* execution logs
* feedback signals

PulseFlow is event-driven by design.

It uses:

* event ingestion
* outbox pattern
* idempotent consumers
* replayable execution logs
* feedback events

PulseFlow answers:

> How does this decision move through the system?

---

## 8. Layer 5 — GreenCore

### Execution Optimization Layer

GreenCore optimizes how validated execution should happen.

It evaluates:

* compute cost
* latency
* energy footprint
* carbon impact
* data sovereignty
* execution location

GreenCore routes execution across:

```text
local
edge
cloud
```

GreenCore answers:

> Where and how should this execute optimally?

GreenCore cannot override PolicyCore.

It only optimizes approved execution paths.

---

## 9. Knowledge Graph Infrastructure

The Knowledge Graph is the system memory layer of QORWAY.

It models organizations as causal systems composed of:

* indicators
* decisions
* actions
* risks
* constraints
* dependencies
* outcomes
* feedback

QORWAY uses two graph levels:

```text
Universal Knowledge Graph
Private Tenant Knowledge Graph
```

### Universal Knowledge Graph

Contains reusable causal structures, domain logic, and anonymized abstractions.

It must never contain identifiable tenant data.

### Private Tenant Knowledge Graph

Contains organization-specific reality.

It is:

* tenant-isolated
* encrypted
* access-controlled
* never merged with another tenant graph

---

## 10. Runtime Model

QORWAY is a runtime system.

It is not a static architecture.

Every decision exists inside a live loop:

```text
input
↓
model
↓
reason
↓
validate
↓
execute
↓
observe
↓
learn
```

This runtime model allows QORWAY to continuously improve decision quality, execution performance, and system intelligence.

---

## 11. Separation of Responsibilities

| Layer        | Responsibility | Must Not Do          |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Atlas        | Reasoning      | Execute decisions    |
| Domain Packs | Context        | Override constraints |
| PolicyCore   | Validation     | Generate decisions   |
| PulseFlow    | Orchestration  | Reason causally      |
| GreenCore    | Optimization   | Override PolicyCore  |

This separation ensures:

* auditability
* maintainability
* regulatory compliance
* system scalability
* tenant safety

---

## 12. Decision Lifecycle

A QORWAY decision follows this lifecycle:

```text
1. Data is ingested
2. Knowledge Graph is updated
3. Atlas generates causal reasoning
4. Domain Pack enriches the context
5. PolicyCore validates the decision
6. PulseFlow creates execution events
7. GreenCore optimizes execution routing
8. Agents / systems execute
9. Feedback is captured
10. Knowledge Graph is updated
```

A decision is invalid if it cannot be traced through this lifecycle.

---

## 13. Execution Model

Execution is event-driven.

No execution happens directly from Atlas.

No execution bypasses PolicyCore.

No execution bypasses PulseFlow.

PulseFlow converts validated decisions into:

* workflow events
* agent tasks
* system updates
* human approval requests
* execution logs
* feedback events

GreenCore then optimizes the approved execution path.

---

## 14. Governance Model

QORWAY governance is native.

Every decision must include:

* causal explanation
* PolicyCore validation status
* execution path
* audit trace
* feedback reference

This enables alignment with:

* GDPR
* EU AI Act
* enterprise audit requirements
* sovereign deployment constraints

---

## 15. Security Architecture

QORWAY follows Zero Trust principles.

Core requirements:

* strict tenant isolation
* AES-256 encryption at rest
* TLS 1.3 in transit
* no cross-tenant leakage
* event-level access control
* audit logs for all decisions and executions

Every request, decision, event, and execution must be tenant-scoped.

---

## 16. What QORWAY Is Not

QORWAY is not:

* a dashboard
* a chatbot
* a BI tool
* a workflow automation tool
* a traditional SaaS product

QORWAY is:

> a decision intelligence infrastructure runtime.

---

## 17. Final Architecture Statement

QORWAY transforms enterprise systems into causal, constrained, executable, and self-improving decision infrastructures.

Its architecture separates reasoning, context, validation, orchestration, and optimization into five coordinated layers:

```text
Atlas → Domain Packs → PolicyCore → PulseFlow → GreenCore
```

Together, they form the foundation for sovereign decision intelligence in Europe.
