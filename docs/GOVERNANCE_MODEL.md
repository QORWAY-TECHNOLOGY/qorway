# Governance Model

**QORWAY Decision Intelligence Infrastructure**

> Governance is not a layer added after intelligence.  
> Governance is embedded into how QORWAY reasons, validates, executes, optimizes, and learns.

---

## 1. Definition

The QORWAY Governance Model defines how decisions are controlled across the full Decision Intelligence Loop.

It ensures that every decision is:

- causal
- explainable
- constrained
- tenant-scoped
- executable
- auditable
- feedback-linked
- aligned with regulatory, financial, ESG, ethical, and system constraints

QORWAY does not treat governance as documentation.

Governance is built into the runtime.

---

## 2. Role in QORWAY OS

The Governance Model exists to prevent uncontrolled intelligence.

Enterprise AI systems fail when:

- decisions are not traceable
- compliance is applied after execution
- constraints are external to the system
- human oversight is inconsistent
- audit trails are incomplete
- data boundaries are unclear
- execution paths are not governed

QORWAY solves this by embedding governance across the full stack:

```text
Atlas → Domain Packs → PolicyCore → PulseFlow → GreenCore → Feedback
````

Governance is applied before, during, and after execution.

---

## 3. Governance Principles

QORWAY governance follows eight core principles.

---

### 3.1 Traceability by Default

Every decision must include:

* decision ID
* tenant ID
* causal chain
* Domain Pack context
* PolicyCore validation status
* PulseFlow execution path
* GreenCore routing decision
* audit metadata
* feedback reference

A decision without traceability is invalid.

---

### 3.2 Constraint-First Intelligence

No decision can move to execution unless it passes PolicyCore validation.

PolicyCore evaluates:

* regulatory constraints
* ESG constraints
* financial constraints
* ethical constraints
* operational constraints
* system capacity constraints
* tenant-specific policies

Core rule:

> No decision is valid unless it passes constraint evaluation.

---

### 3.3 Context-Aware Governance

Domain Packs provide the domain context required for governance.

A decision cannot be governed correctly unless the system understands:

* the domain structure
* applicable rules
* allowed actions
* risks
* gates
* expected outcomes
* required evidence

Domain Packs make governance domain-specific.

---

### 3.4 Human Oversight Where Required

QORWAY supports human-in-the-loop governance for sensitive or high-impact decisions.

Human oversight may be required when:

* the decision affects financial exposure
* the decision impacts regulated domains
* the decision triggers high-risk execution
* PolicyCore requires approval
* tenant policy mandates human review
* execution may materially affect people, capital, compliance, or public interest

Human oversight must be logged as part of the decision trace.

---

### 3.5 Tenant Sovereignty

Each tenant operates inside an isolated decision environment.

Tenant sovereignty includes:

* isolated data
* isolated Knowledge Graph
* isolated constraints
* isolated Domain Pack instantiation
* isolated execution policies
* isolated audit logs
* isolated feedback loop

No governance decision may cross tenant boundaries.

---

### 3.6 Auditability as Runtime Evidence

QORWAY produces audit artifacts automatically.

Auditability is not manually reconstructed later.

Every decision, event, constraint validation, execution, routing decision, and feedback signal must be recorded as evidence.

---

### 3.7 Execution Accountability

A decision is incomplete until its execution is logged.

PulseFlow ensures that execution is:

* event-based
* authorized
* tenant-scoped
* replayable where required
* linked to a validated decision

Execution without an audit trail is invalid.

---

### 3.8 No Unbounded Intelligence

QORWAY intelligence is bounded by:

* causal structure
* Domain Pack logic
* PolicyCore constraints
* tenant policies
* security boundaries
* human oversight rules
* execution authorization
* GreenCore routing boundaries

QORWAY must never produce or execute unconstrained decisions.

---

## 4. Governance Architecture

The governance architecture is distributed across the full QORWAY stack.

```text
DATA
  ↓
KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
  ↓
ATLAS
  ↓
DOMAIN PACKS
  ↓
POLICYCORE
  ↓
DECISION
  ↓
PULSEFLOW
  ↓
GREENCORE
  ↓
EXECUTION
  ↓
FEEDBACK LOOP
```

Governance is enforced at each stage.

---

## 5. Layer Responsibilities

| Layer           | Governance Responsibility                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge Graph | Stores decision memory, causal lineage, evidence nodes, and feedback links      |
| Atlas           | Produces explainable causal decisions                                           |
| Domain Packs    | Provide domain-specific rules, gates, risks, actions, and evidence requirements |
| PolicyCore      | Validates decisions under constraints                                           |
| PulseFlow       | Ensures governed execution and event traceability                               |
| GreenCore       | Optimizes execution without violating constraints                               |
| Feedback Loop   | Captures outcomes and updates governance evidence                               |

---

## 6. PolicyCore as Governance Authority

PolicyCore is the primary governance enforcement layer.

It determines whether a decision is:

```text
APPROVED
MODIFIED
REJECTED
```

PolicyCore evaluates decisions against:

* law
* regulation
* tenant policy
* ESG threshold
* financial exposure limits
* operational capacity
* system risk
* human oversight requirements

No execution can bypass PolicyCore.

Core rule:

> PolicyCore defines what is allowed. Everything else must operate within that boundary.

---

## 7. Domain Pack Governance

Domain Packs make governance domain-specific.

A Domain Pack defines:

* domain ontology
* causal rules
* allowed actions
* risks
* gates
* outcomes
* events
* evidence requirements
* PolicyCore constraints
* GreenCore execution preferences
* feedback rules
* systemic impact model

Domain Packs do not replace PolicyCore.

They provide the domain structure that PolicyCore evaluates.

Core rule:

> Domain Packs structure reality. PolicyCore validates reality.

---

## 8. Governance Decision Flow

```text
Atlas generates causal decision
  ↓
Domain Pack provides domain context
  ↓
PolicyCore evaluates constraints
  ↓
Decision is approved / modified / rejected
  ↓
PulseFlow executes only approved path
  ↓
GreenCore optimizes execution path
  ↓
Execution is logged
  ↓
Feedback is captured
  ↓
Knowledge Graph is updated
```

---

## 9. Decision Governance Object

Every governed decision must be represented as a structured object.

Example:

```json
{
  "decision_id": "dec_001",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_001",
  "domain_pack": "finance_pack",
  "domain_pack_version": "1.0.0",
  "causal_chain_id": "chain_042",
  "policy_status": "approved",
  "policycore_result": {
    "decision": "APPROVED",
    "constraints_checked": [
      "financial_exposure_limit",
      "human_approval_required",
      "gdpr_data_scope"
    ],
    "required_human_approval": true
  },
  "execution_status": "pending",
  "greencore_status": "routing_required",
  "audit_status": "traceable"
}
```

---

## 10. Constraint Types

PolicyCore supports several constraint types.

| Constraint Type         | Behavior                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Hard Block              | Execution forbidden                 |
| Soft Limit              | Warning + degraded execution        |
| Modification Rule       | Decision must be adjusted           |
| Human Approval          | Execution requires human validation |
| Simulation Constraint   | Affects scenario outcomes           |
| Optimization Constraint | Influences GreenCore routing        |

---

## 11. Human-in-the-Loop Governance

Human approval is required when:

* PolicyCore marks the decision as high risk
* the tenant defines mandatory approval
* regulatory classification requires oversight
* execution may materially affect financial, legal, ESG, human, or operational exposure
* simulation drift exceeds the threshold defined in the Domain Pack
* the decision impacts public interest or institutional accountability

A human approval event must include:

* approver identity
* role
* timestamp
* approval decision
* reason
* linked decision ID
* linked PolicyCore result

Example:

```json
{
  "event_type": "decision.human_approval.granted",
  "decision_id": "dec_001",
  "approved_by": "user_001",
  "role": "CFO",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-05T10:00:00Z",
  "approval_reason": "Financial exposure within approved threshold",
  "policycore_result_id": "pol_001"
}
```

---

## 12. Audit Trail Model

QORWAY generates audit trails across the full lifecycle.

Audit trail components include:

* data source reference
* Knowledge Graph node references
* causal chain
* Domain Pack name and version
* PolicyCore validation result
* human approval events
* PulseFlow execution events
* GreenCore routing decision
* outcome feedback
* timestamped logs
* tenant boundary metadata

A complete audit trail must answer:

```text
What decision was made?
Why was it made?
Which domain rules applied?
What constraints were checked?
Who approved it?
How was it executed?
Where was it executed?
What happened afterward?
What did the system learn?
```

---

## 13. EU AI Act Alignment

QORWAY is designed to support governance requirements for high-risk decision environments.

The Governance Model supports:

* explainability
* human oversight
* risk management
* logging
* transparency
* technical documentation
* data governance
* accountability

QORWAY does not rely on post-hoc explanation.

Explanation is generated as part of the decision lifecycle.

---

## 14. GDPR Alignment

QORWAY supports GDPR-aligned governance through:

* data minimization
* tenant isolation
* access control
* encryption
* audit logs
* restricted data processing
* privacy-aware routing
* data residency controls

Tenant data must never be exposed to another tenant.

Sensitive data must never leave approved execution boundaries without governance approval.

---

## 15. Multi-Tenant Governance

Each tenant has its own governance boundary.

Tenant-specific governance includes:

* PolicyCore rules
* Domain Pack configuration
* Private Knowledge Graph
* user roles
* approval rules
* audit logs
* GreenCore execution policies
* feedback rules
* data classification rules

Core rule:

> Governance is tenant-scoped by default.

---

## 16. Role-Based Governance

QORWAY may support multiple governance roles.

Example roles:

| Role                   | Responsibility                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Executive              | Approves strategic decisions           |
| CFO                    | Validates capital allocation decisions |
| Compliance Officer     | Reviews regulatory constraints         |
| Risk Officer           | Reviews systemic risk                  |
| Sustainability Officer | Reviews ESG / carbon exposure          |
| Domain Operator        | Executes domain-specific workflows     |
| System Admin           | Manages access and infrastructure      |
| AI Agent               | Performs bounded execution tasks       |

Each role must operate within explicit permissions.

---

## 17. GreenCore Governance

GreenCore participates in governance by ensuring that execution is aligned with:

* cost policy
* carbon policy
* execution zone policy
* sovereignty policy
* tenant energy preferences
* domain-specific execution policies

GreenCore cannot approve decisions rejected by PolicyCore.

GreenCore can only optimize execution paths that are already valid.

Core rule:

> GreenCore governs how approved execution happens. It does not decide what is allowed.

---

## 18. PulseFlow Governance

PulseFlow provides execution governance by ensuring that every action is:

* event-based
* tenant-scoped
* authorized
* traceable
* replayable where required
* linked to a validated decision
* linked to an execution outcome

PulseFlow must never execute a rejected or unvalidated decision.

Core rule:

> No PulseFlow execution can occur without PolicyCore validation.

---

## 19. Feedback Governance

Feedback is part of governance.

Every execution must produce a feedback signal where possible.

Feedback may include:

* expected vs actual outcome
* financial deviation
* operational deviation
* compliance deviation
* execution delay
* carbon / compute impact
* human approval outcome
* simulation drift

Domain Packs may define feedback thresholds.

Example:

```json
{
  "simulation_drift_threshold": 0.15,
  "drift_behavior": "trigger_human_review",
  "event": "diagnostic.signal.generated"
}
```

If simulation and execution diverge beyond the threshold, QORWAY must generate a diagnostic signal.

---

## 20. Governance Evidence

QORWAY produces governance evidence as runtime artifacts.

Evidence may include:

* decision trace
* causal evidence log
* constraint matrix
* execution log
* GreenCore routing trace
* carbon trace
* human approval log
* feedback report
* diagnostic signal

These artifacts support internal audit, regulatory review, and enterprise governance.

---

## 21. Governance Failure Conditions

A decision or execution path is governance-invalid if:

* it lacks a tenant ID
* it has no causal chain
* it has no Domain Pack context where required
* it bypasses PolicyCore
* it lacks required human approval
* it violates tenant policy
* it produces no audit trail
* it executes outside allowed boundaries
* it bypasses PulseFlow
* it bypasses GreenCore routing where required
* it cannot be linked to feedback
* it cannot be explained

---

## 22. What QORWAY Governance Is Not

QORWAY Governance is not:

* a compliance checklist
* a static policy document
* a reporting dashboard
* legal advice
* post-hoc audit reconstruction
* ESG reporting alone

It is a live governance infrastructure embedded into decision execution.

---

## 23. Strategic Importance

Governance is one of QORWAY’s core differentiators.

Traditional systems apply governance after decisions have already been made.

QORWAY embeds governance inside the decision runtime.

This allows QORWAY to support:

* regulated enterprise environments
* public-sector decision systems
* ESG / CSRD traceability
* financial risk governance
* AI Act-aligned decision accountability
* sovereign multi-tenant execution

Governance is not a compliance feature.

It is the system boundary that makes decision intelligence deployable at scale.

---

## 24. Final Statement

The QORWAY Governance Model ensures that intelligence is not only powerful, but controllable, explainable, auditable, and safe to execute.

> QORWAY governs decisions before they become reality.
