# Domain Pack Standard v2.0

**QORWAY Decision Intelligence Infrastructure**  
**Declarative Cognitive Configuration + Systemic Impact Model**

> A Domain Pack is how QORWAY turns a business, institutional, or operational domain into an executable causal decision system.

---

## 1. Definition

A Domain Pack is a declarative cognitive configuration that transforms the QORWAY core into a domain-specific decision system.

It defines:

- how the domain is represented
- how causal relationships are understood
- how decisions are generated
- which constraints apply
- how execution should be routed
- which agents may act
- which events exist
- how outcomes are measured
- how the system learns from feedback
- how systemic impact is evaluated

A Domain Pack is not a database.

It is not a SaaS module.

It is not a prompt library.

It is a structured intelligence package that makes Atlas operational inside a specific domain.

---

## 2. Role in QORWAY OS

Domain Packs are the Context & Business Intelligence Layer of QORWAY.

They sit between Atlas and PolicyCore.

```text
ATLAS
  ↓
DOMAIN PACKS
  ↓
POLICYCORE
  ↓
PULSEFLOW
  ↓
GREENCORE
  ↓
EXECUTION
  ↓
FEEDBACK LOOP
````

Atlas provides causal reasoning.

Domain Packs provide domain structure.

PolicyCore validates constraints.

PulseFlow orchestrates execution.

GreenCore optimizes the execution path.

---

## 3. Why Domain Packs Exist

Generic AI systems fail in enterprise and institutional environments because they do not understand domain structure.

They may generate fluent outputs, but they lack:

* domain ontologies
* causal dependencies
* regulatory logic
* decision gates
* execution pathways
* measurable outcomes
* feedback rules
* systemic impact modeling

Domain Packs solve this by encoding structured domain intelligence into QORWAY.

They make Atlas domain-aware without training data, fine-tuning, or custom core development.

---

## 4. Core Principle

A Domain Pack does not train Atlas.

A Domain Pack structures reality for Atlas.

QORWAY does not rely on fine-tuning to become domain-aware.

It relies on:

```text
GRAPH → CAUSAL → DECISION → CONSTRAINT → EXECUTION → FEEDBACK
```

Domain Packs allow QORWAY to create domain-specific decision systems without modifying the core infrastructure.

---

## 5. Canonical Domain Pack Structure

Every Domain Pack should follow this canonical structure:

```text
domains/<domain_name>/
│
├── domain.yaml
│
├── graph.schema.json
├── causal.rules.json
├── decision.policies.json
├── policycore.constraints.json
├── greencore.policy.json
├── agents.registry.json
├── events.schema.json
├── feedback.rules.json
│
├── steps.impact_model.json
│
└── prompts/
    ├── reasoning.prompt.md
    ├── decision.prompt.md
    ├── explanation.prompt.md
    └── agent.prompt.md
```

This structure enables QORWAY to load a Domain Pack as an executable domain configuration.

The QORWAY core does not change.

The Domain Pack injects:

* graph structure
* causal rules
* decision policies
* constraint rules
* execution preferences
* agents
* events
* feedback logic
* impact model
* prompt behavior

---

## 6. Domain Metadata

The `domain.yaml` file is the entry point of the Domain Pack.

It defines the identity, scope, jurisdiction, and internal references of the pack.

Example:

```yaml
name: "ESG / CSRD Pack"
version: "1.0.0"
domain_type: "esg_csrd"
description: "Causal decision intelligence pack for ESG and CSRD compliance."

jurisdiction:
  - EU
  - FR

core_entities:
  - indicator
  - action
  - risk
  - gate
  - outcome
  - constraint
  - event
  - decision

entry_graph: graph.schema.json
causal_model: causal.rules.json
decision_engine: decision.policies.json
policy_constraints: policycore.constraints.json
execution_policy: greencore.policy.json
agents: agents.registry.json
events: events.schema.json
feedback_rules: feedback.rules.json
impact_model: steps.impact_model.json
```

---

## 7. Knowledge Graph Schema

The `graph.schema.json` file defines how the domain is represented.

Typical node types include:

* Indicator
* Action
* Risk
* Gate
* Outcome
* Constraint
* Event
* Decision
* Actor
* Resource
* System
* Stakeholder

Typical relationship types include:

* CAUSES
* MITIGATES
* REQUIRES
* BLOCKS
* ENABLES
* AFFECTS
* YIELDS
* TRIGGERS
* DEPENDS_ON
* EVIDENCES

Example:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "type": "Indicator", "id": "IND_E1_004", "label": "Scope 3 emissions" },
    { "type": "Risk", "id": "RISK_E1_001", "label": "CSRD non-compliance risk" },
    { "type": "Action", "id": "ACT_E1_002", "label": "Decarbonization plan" },
    { "type": "Gate", "id": "GATE_RSE_3", "label": "CSRD reporting readiness" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "IND_E1_004",
      "to": "RISK_E1_001",
      "type": "CAUSES",
      "weight": 0.92
    },
    {
      "from": "ACT_E1_002",
      "to": "RISK_E1_001",
      "type": "MITIGATES",
      "weight": 0.86
    }
  ]
}
```

The graph schema defines what exists.

It does not execute.

It gives Atlas the domain structure required for reasoning.

---

## 8. Causal Rules

The `causal.rules.json` file defines how the system understands cause and effect inside the domain.

A causal rule must include:

* cause
* effect
* weight or confidence
* trigger condition
* expected lag where relevant
* business meaning
* expected impact
* explainability metadata

Example:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "RULE_E1_SCOPE3_RISK",
  "cause": "IND_E1_004",
  "condition": "value > threshold_critical",
  "effect": "RISK_E1_001",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "lag_months": 0,
  "impact": "CSRD reporting risk increases",
  "recommended_action": "ACT_E1_002",
  "explainability": "Scope 3 emissions above critical threshold increase CSRD non-compliance exposure."
}
```

Core rule:

> No causal rule is valid unless it can be explained and audited.

---

## 9. Decision Policies

The `decision.policies.json` file defines which domain-level decisions or actions Atlas may recommend.

Decision policies transform causal understanding into possible action.

Example:

```json
{
  "policy_id": "POLICY_ESG_REPORTING_READINESS",
  "condition": "RISK_E1_001.active = true",
  "allowed_actions": [
    "ACT_E1_001",
    "ACT_E1_002"
  ],
  "blocked_actions": [
    "SUBMIT_REPORT"
  ],
  "requires_policycore_validation": true
}
```

Decision policies do not replace PolicyCore.

They define domain-level logic.

PolicyCore validates whether the proposed decision can exist under real-world constraints.

---

## 10. PolicyCore Constraints

The `policycore.constraints.json` file defines the constraint layer attached to the Domain Pack.

PolicyCore determines whether a decision is:

```text
APPROVED
MODIFIED
REJECTED
```

Constraints may include:

* regulatory constraints
* GDPR constraints
* EU AI Act constraints
* ESG constraints
* financial constraints
* ethical constraints
* system capacity constraints
* tenant-specific constraints

Example:

```json
{
  "constraint_id": "CONSTRAINT_MAX_CARBON_INTENSITY",
  "constraint": "max_carbon_intensity",
  "scope": "supply_chain",
  "threshold": 0.7,
  "severity": "hard_block",
  "enforcement": "pre_execution",
  "linked_domain": "supply_chain_pack"
}
```

Constraint types:

| Type                    | Behavior                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Hard Block              | Execution forbidden                 |
| Soft Limit              | Warning + degraded execution        |
| Modification Rule       | Decision must be adjusted           |
| Human Approval          | Execution requires human validation |
| Simulation Constraint   | Affects scenario outcomes           |
| Optimization Constraint | Influences GreenCore routing        |

Core rule:

> Domain Packs can propose. PolicyCore decides whether the proposal is valid.

---

## 11. GreenCore Execution Policy

The `greencore.policy.json` file defines how approved decisions should be executed efficiently and sovereignly.

GreenCore does not validate legality.

GreenCore optimizes execution.

It evaluates:

* compute cost
* latency
* carbon footprint
* energy usage
* data sensitivity
* execution location
* sovereignty preference
* tenant policies

Example:

```json
{
  "preferred_execution": "edge",
  "cloud_allowed": false,
  "carbon_tracking_required": true,
  "sovereignty_priority": "high",
  "sensitive_data": true,
  "fallback_execution": "local"
}
```

Core rule:

> PolicyCore defines what is allowed. GreenCore defines the best execution path for what is allowed.

---

## 12. Action Registry

The `actions.registry.json` file defines available actions inside the Domain Pack.

Each action must include:

* action ID
* label
* domain
* prerequisites
* expected impact
* estimated effort
* execution requirements
* linked PulseFlow event
* feedback expectation

Example:

```json
{
  "action_id": "ACT_E1_002",
  "label": "Create decarbonization plan",
  "domain": "esg_csrd",
  "prerequisites": ["ACT_E1_001"],
  "expected_impact": {
    "metric": "IND_E1_005",
    "direction": "decrease",
    "timeline_months": 6
  },
  "effort_days": 12,
  "execution_event": "esg.action.decarbonization_plan.requested",
  "expected_feedback_event": "esg.outcome.decarbonization_plan.completed"
}
```

An action is invalid if it cannot be translated into a PulseFlow event.

---

## 13. Gate Model

The `gates.model.json` file defines maturity, readiness, compliance, or progression milestones.

A gate must include:

* gate ID
* label
* required actions
* required indicators
* blocking rules
* unlock conditions
* outcome produced
* related PolicyCore constraints

Example:

```json
{
  "gate_id": "GATE_RSE_3",
  "label": "CSRD reporting readiness",
  "required_indicators": [
    "IND_E1_001",
    "IND_E1_002",
    "IND_E1_004"
  ],
  "required_actions": [
    "ACT_E1_001"
  ],
  "blocks": [
    "OUT_CSRD_REPORT_SUBMISSION"
  ],
  "unlock_condition": "all_required_indicators_available = true",
  "requires_policycore_validation": true
}
```

Gates are not UI milestones.

They are system control points.

---

## 14. Risk Model

The `risks.model.json` file defines risk structures inside the domain.

A risk must include:

* risk ID
* label
* source indicators
* probability model
* financial impact
* regulatory impact
* operational impact
* mitigation actions
* escalation level

Example:

```json
{
  "risk_id": "RISK_E1_001",
  "label": "CSRD non-compliance risk",
  "source_indicators": ["IND_E1_004"],
  "probability": 0.78,
  "impact": {
    "financial": "high",
    "regulatory": "high",
    "operational": "medium"
  },
  "mitigation_actions": [
    "ACT_E1_001",
    "ACT_E1_002"
  ]
}
```

Every risk must have a mitigation path.

---

## 15. Outcome Model

The `outcomes.model.json` file defines the expected results of decisions and actions.

An outcome must include:

* outcome ID
* label
* measurable metric
* expected timeline
* evidence required
* feedback event
* drift tolerance

Example:

```json
{
  "outcome_id": "OUT_CSRD_READY",
  "label": "CSRD reporting readiness achieved",
  "metric": "CSRD readiness score",
  "expected_timeline_months": 6,
  "evidence_required": [
    "IND_E1_001",
    "IND_E1_002",
    "IND_E1_004"
  ],
  "feedback_event": "esg.outcome.csrd_ready.observed",
  "drift_tolerance": 0.15
}
```

Outcomes are required for feedback learning.

---

## 16. Agents Registry

The `agents.registry.json` file declares which agents may act inside the Domain Pack.

Agents are not coded inside the Domain Pack.

They are declared as bounded execution roles.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "analysis_agent",
    "role": "interprets causal output",
    "allowed_events": [
      "decision.generated",
      "risk.activated"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "execution_agent",
    "role": "executes approved decisions",
    "allowed_events": [
      "action.execution.requested"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "monitoring_agent",
    "role": "tracks outcomes and emits feedback",
    "allowed_events": [
      "outcome.observed"
    ]
  }
]
```

Agents must operate within PolicyCore, PulseFlow, and tenant boundaries.

---

## 17. Event Schema

The `events.schema.json` file defines the events that PulseFlow can use.

Events may include:

* decision requested
* decision approved
* decision rejected
* action started
* gate blocked
* gate unlocked
* risk activated
* outcome observed
* feedback generated
* diagnostic signal generated

Example:

```json
{
  "event_type": "esg.gate.blocked",
  "domain_pack": "esg_csrd_pack",
  "required_fields": [
    "tenant_id",
    "decision_id",
    "gate_id",
    "reason",
    "timestamp"
  ]
}
```

Core rule:

> If a Domain Pack action cannot emit or consume events, it is not executable.

---

## 18. Feedback Rules

The `feedback.rules.json` file defines how the Domain Pack learns from execution outcomes.

Feedback rules define:

* simulation drift threshold
* outcome deviation behavior
* human review trigger
* causal weight update logic
* confidence score update logic
* diagnostic signal events

Example:

```json
{
  "simulation_drift_threshold": 0.15,
  "drift_behavior": "trigger_human_review",
  "event": "diagnostic.signal.generated",
  "updates": [
    "causal_weight",
    "confidence_score",
    "risk_pattern"
  ]
}
```

This means:

> If Atlas simulation and real execution diverge by more than 15%, the system must generate a diagnostic signal for human review.

Feedback rules prevent the system from silently drifting into false intelligence.

---

## 19. STEPS Impact Model

The `steps.impact_model.json` file defines the systemic impact lens of the Domain Pack.

STEPS stands for:

```text
S — Social
T — Technological
E — Economic
P — Political / Policy
S — Sustainability
```

The STEPS model evaluates how a decision affects broader systems beyond local optimization.

It is especially important for:

* public-sector Domain Packs
* regulated industries
* ESG / CSRD Packs
* Supply Chain Packs
* Risk Packs
* Finance Packs with systemic exposure
* Regulator Packs

Example:

```json
{
  "dimensions": {
    "social": {
      "inputs": ["citizen_acceptance", "inequality_index"],
      "outputs": ["social_cohesion_impact"]
    },
    "technological": {
      "inputs": ["digital_maturity", "technical_debt"],
      "outputs": ["automation_roi"]
    },
    "economic": {
      "inputs": ["budget_allocated", "inflation_rate"],
      "outputs": ["budget_efficiency"]
    },
    "political": {
      "inputs": ["regulatory_alignment", "policy_risk"],
      "outputs": ["non_compliance_risk"]
    },
    "sustainability": {
      "inputs": ["energy_consumption", "co2_impact"],
      "outputs": ["greencore_execution_score"]
    }
  }
}
```

Core rule:

> STEPS is not the full domain schema. It is the systemic impact lens applied to domain decisions.

---

## 20. Prompts Layer

The `prompts/` folder defines the cognitive behavior of Atlas and agents within the domain.

Prompts are used only as controlled interfaces.

They do not replace graph structure, causal rules, or PolicyCore constraints.

### `reasoning.prompt.md`

Defines how Atlas should reason over domain structures.

Example:

```text
You are the causal reasoning engine for the {domain} system.
Analyze relationships between entities and produce causal insights.
All outputs must reference graph structure and causal rules.
```

### `decision.prompt.md`

Defines how causal insights are converted into structured decisions.

Example:

```text
Convert causal insights into structured, prioritized decisions.
Ensure explainability, traceability, and PolicyCore compatibility.
```

### `explanation.prompt.md`

Defines how explanations are generated for users or audit outputs.

Example:

```text
Explain the decision using causal chains, constraints checked, and expected impact.
Do not introduce unsupported reasoning.
```

### `agent.prompt.md`

Defines how agents operate inside bounded execution roles.

Example:

```text
Execute only PolicyCore-approved decisions using available PulseFlow events.
Log all outputs into the event system.
```

Core rule:

> Prompts format intelligence. They do not create domain truth.

---

## 21. Runtime Loader

The QORWAY core loads Domain Packs without changing the core system.

```text
Domain Pack
    ↓
Core Runtime Loader
    ↓
Registers:
  - graph schema
  - causal rules
  - decision policies
  - PolicyCore constraints
  - GreenCore policies
  - agents
  - events
  - feedback rules
  - impact model
    ↓
Atlas becomes domain-aware
    ↓
QORWAY becomes a domain-specific decision system
```

The core remains stable.

The Domain Pack injects configuration.

---

## 22. Standard vs Private Domain Packs

QORWAY supports two Domain Pack categories.

---

### 22.1 Standard Domain Packs

Standard Domain Packs are reusable across organizations.

They contain:

* generic domain ontology
* reusable causal rules
* public regulatory structures
* common risk patterns
* standardized decision templates

Examples:

* ESG / CSRD Pack
* Finance Pack
* Risk Pack
* Supply Chain Pack
* Governance Pack
* Regulator Pack

They must never contain private tenant data.

---

### 22.2 Private Domain Packs

Private Domain Packs are tenant-specific extensions.

They contain:

* organization-specific workflows
* proprietary decision logic
* private causal relationships
* internal dependencies
* sensitive operating structures

They are:

* tenant-isolated
* access-controlled
* encrypted
* non-transferable
* never merged into another tenant graph

Core rule:

> Standard Packs define shared domain structure. Private Packs define sovereign organizational reality.

---

## 23. Deployment Lifecycle

A Domain Pack lifecycle follows six phases:

```text
1. Definition
2. Validation
3. Instantiation
4. Execution
5. Feedback refinement
6. Versioning
```

---

### 23.1 Definition

The pack is defined through schemas, causal rules, policies, events, and impact model.

---

### 23.2 Validation

The pack is validated for:

* schema integrity
* causal consistency
* no orphan nodes
* no risk without mitigation
* no action without event path
* PolicyCore compatibility
* GreenCore compatibility
* feedback rules completeness
* STEPS impact completeness where required

---

### 23.3 Instantiation

The pack is instantiated inside a tenant environment.

This creates:

* tenant-specific graph nodes
* active domain logic
* execution mappings
* policy bindings
* feedback pathways

---

### 23.4 Execution

The pack becomes operational through:

```text
Atlas → Domain Pack → PolicyCore → PulseFlow → GreenCore → Execution
```

---

### 23.5 Feedback Refinement

Execution outcomes update:

* confidence scores
* causal weights
* risk patterns
* decision heuristics
* feedback rules where authorized

Private tenant feedback must not leak into the universal graph without anonymization and governance approval.

---

### 23.6 Versioning

Each Domain Pack must be versioned.

Versioning must track:

* graph changes
* causal rule changes
* policy changes
* event changes
* feedback rule changes
* impact model changes

Production environments must never silently upgrade critical Domain Packs without governance approval.

---

## 24. Domain Pack Validation Rules

A Domain Pack is invalid if:

* it has orphan nodes
* it contains actions without execution events
* it lacks PolicyCore compatibility
* it lacks GreenCore compatibility
* it contains untraceable causal rules
* it has risks without mitigation paths
* it has outcomes without feedback events
* it includes private tenant data in a Standard Pack
* it cannot generate audit-ready decision traces
* it lacks STEPS impact modeling where required
* it has no versioning metadata

---

## 25. Example Domain Pack Categories

### ESG / CSRD Pack

Purpose:

* CSRD readiness
* ESRS indicator mapping
* ESG risk detection
* audit-ready reporting paths
* GreenCore carbon trace integration

---

### Finance Pack

Purpose:

* capital allocation
* margin causality
* cashflow risk propagation
* financial decision simulation
* risk-adjusted capital logic

---

### Supply Chain Pack

Purpose:

* supplier risk modeling
* logistics optimization
* Scope 3 impact mapping
* operational resilience
* route and dependency simulation

---

### Risk Pack

Purpose:

* enterprise risk propagation
* systemic exposure modeling
* mitigation path generation
* compliance escalation
* scenario stress testing

---

### Governance Pack

Purpose:

* decision accountability
* control frameworks
* role-based decision authority
* executive traceability
* human oversight rules

---

### Regulator Pack

Purpose:

* public-sector decision traceability
* policy impact simulation
* institutional risk modeling
* regulatory alignment checks
* STEPS systemic impact evaluation

---

## 26. What Domain Packs Are Not

Domain Packs are not:

* SaaS modules
* static templates
* dashboards
* prompt libraries
* consulting reports
* fine-tuned models
* standalone applications
* raw databases

Domain Packs are executable intelligence structures.

---

## 27. Strategic Importance

Domain Packs are central to QORWAY’s platform logic.

They enable QORWAY to create domain-specific decision systems without rewriting the core.

This creates:

* faster deployment
* reusable intelligence
* domain scalability
* lower implementation cost
* stronger auditability
* standardized execution logic
* sovereign tenant-specific extensions

The strategic moat is not only the core engine.

It is the ability to create unlimited domain-specific decision systems through declarative intelligence.

---

## 28. Final Definition

A Domain Pack is a declarative cognitive configuration that transforms the QORWAY causal intelligence core into a domain-specific executable decision system by defining its Knowledge Graph, causal rules, decision policies, PolicyCore constraints, GreenCore execution preferences, agents, events, feedback rules, prompts, and systemic impact model.

Final system statement:

> A Domain Pack is how QORWAY converts domain reality into causal, constrained, executable intelligence.
